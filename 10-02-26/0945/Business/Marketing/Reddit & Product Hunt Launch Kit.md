# Reddit Launch Strategy & Copy

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Reddit Account Requirements

**New accounts get banned instantly if you:**
- Post links to your own product
- Use promotional language
- Don't have comment karma
- Post in multiple subreddits at once

**Safe approach:**

### Step 1: Account Warm-up (Do this FIRST)
**Spend 3-5 days BEFORE posting:**
- Comment on other people's posts (genuine helpful comments)
- Build 50-100 comment karma
- Participate in discussions
- Don't mention your product at all

### Step 2: Value-First Posting
**Never post "I built this" as your first post in a subreddit.**

Instead, use these proven formats:

---

## r/selfhosted Post (Safe Format)

**Title:** I analyzed my $200/month SaaS spending and cut it by 90%

**Body:**
```
Like many of you, I was running a self-hosted stack but still paying for a dozen SaaS subscriptions. Last month I audited everything:

**What I was paying for:**
- Notion Pro: $10/month
- Todoist: $4/month  
- Various productivity tools: $15/month
- Cloud storage: $20/month
- **Total: ~$200/month**

**What I realized:**
Most of these are just CRUD apps with sync. I could build local-first versions that work offline and cost nothing monthly.

**What I did:**
Built (and open-sourced the concept) local-first alternatives:
- Notes app with tagging/folders (replaces Notion for personal use)
- Kanban board (replaces Trello/Todoist)
- Both are single HTML files, work offline, store data locally

**The result:**
- $200/month → $0/month
- Faster (no network latency)
- Actually private (no cloud)
- Export to JSON/Markdown anytime

**The trade-offs:**
- No real-time collaboration (I don't need this)
- Manual sync between devices (I use Syncthing)
- Takes 10 seconds to load vs 2 seconds

**My question to the community:**
What's your monthly SaaS spend? Are you self-hosting alternatives or still paying for convenience?

EDIT: Since people are asking, I put the tools up at [iamhicks.com]. Not selling anything, just sharing what worked for me.
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with value (audit your spending)
- Asks a question (engagement)
- Mentions product only in edit (after traction)
- Frame as "sharing" not "promoting"

## r/productivity Post (Safe Format)

**Title:** After 5 years of trying every productivity app, I went back to basics

**Body:**
```
I've tried them all: Notion, Todoist, Obsidian, Roam, ClickUp, Asana, you name it.

**What I learned:**
The tool doesn't matter. The system matters.

**My current (minimal) setup:**
1. **Capture** - Notes app (offline, fast, no sync issues)
2. **Execute** - Kanban board (3 columns: To Do, Doing, Done)
3. **Review** - Weekly export to review

**Why this beats complex setups:**
- Opens instantly (no loading)
- Works on planes, trains, anywhere
- No "setup" time - just open and work
- No subscription anxiety
- I own my data (JSON exports)

**What I eliminated:**
- ✅ Databases (overkill for personal use)
- ✅ Automation (just do the thing)
- ✅ Templates (create once, reuse)
- ✅ Collaboration features (I work alone)
- ✅ 50 plugins (distraction)

**The result:**
I'm actually productive now. Not "organizing my productivity system" productive. Actually doing work productive.

**Your turn:** What's the simplest productivity setup that's actually worked for you long-term? Not "I set this up and it was beautiful for 3 days" — what's still working after 6 months?
```

**Wait 2-3 hours, then edit to add:**
```
EDIT: Several people asked what I'm using. I built something minimal that fits this workflow: [iamhicks.com]. Single HTML files, no install, works offline. Sharing in case it helps anyone else simplify.
```

## r/IndieHackers Post (Safe Format)

**Title:** Launched my first product: $0 MRR but learned a ton

**Body:**
```
**The numbers:**
- Time to build: 6 months (nights & weekends)
- Revenue so far: $0 (launched today)
- Marketing spend: $0
- Lines of code: ~5,000
- Tech stack: Vanilla JS, single HTML files

**What I built:**
Offline-first productivity tools. Think "Notion but it actually works without internet" and "Trello without the subscription."

**Why I built it:**
I was paying $200/month for productivity SaaS and realized I don't need 90% of the features. I needed:
- Notes that open instantly
- Task boards that work on planes
- Data that stays on my machine

**The launch:**
- No email list (0 subscribers)
- No Twitter following (42 followers)
- No Product Hunt audience
- Just posting to communities and hoping it resonates

**The business model:**
$29 one-time purchase. No subscription. Lifetime updates.

**Why this model sucks (honestly):**
- No recurring revenue
- Harder to grow
- Customers expect perpetual support

**Why I'm doing it anyway:**
- I hate subscriptions as a consumer
- It's different in a sea of SaaS
- I can sleep at night

**What I need help with:**
- Where do privacy-conscious productivity people hang out?
- How do you market "offline-first" without sounding like a luddite?
- Anyone have experience with one-time purchase software?

**The product:** [iamhicks.com] if you want to roast it.
```

**Why this works for IndieHackers:**
- Transparency about $0 revenue (they love honesty)
- Asks for help (engagement)
- Shows the struggle (relatable)
- Mentions product at end (acceptable)

## Hacker News "Show HN" Post

**Title:** Show HN: Offline-first productivity tools I built after paying $200/mo for SaaS

**Body:**
```
I was paying for Notion, Todoist, and a dozen other productivity tools. Last month I audited my subscriptions and realized I was spending $200/month on software that mostly just stores text and moves cards between columns.

So I built offline-first alternatives:

**MIND** - Knowledge base (replaces Notion for personal use)
- Rich text editor, no markdown to learn
- Tag-based organization with multi-filter
- Full-text search
- Exports to Markdown/JSON

**FLOW** - Kanban board (replaces Trello/Todoist)
- Drag-and-drop columns
- Recurring tasks
- Calendar view
- Custom labels

**Technical details:**
- Single HTML files (no install, just open in browser)
- LocalStorage for data (no backend)
- Works offline (no internet required)
- Vanilla JS, no frameworks

**The "why":**
- Speed: Opens instantly vs 3-5 second load times
- Privacy: Data never leaves my machine
- Ownership: $29 one-time, not $10/month forever
- Portability: Copy the HTML file anywhere

**Trade-offs:**
- No real-time collaboration
- No native mobile apps (works in mobile browsers)
- Manual sync between devices (I use Dropbox for the HTML file)

**Pricing:** $29 one-time purchase. Trying the "no subscription" experiment.

**Demo:** [iamhicks.com/mind-demo] and [iamhicks.com/flow-demo] (resets hourly)

Would love feedback, especially on:
1. Is localStorage reliable enough for serious note-taking?
2. How do you handle sync between devices with offline-first apps?
3. What's the sweet spot between "simple" and "too simple"?
```

**HN Tips:**
- Post at 9-10 AM PST (peak HN traffic)
- Post from Tuesday-Thursday (best days)
- Respond to EVERY comment within first 2 hours
- Be humble, accept criticism graciously
- Don't get defensive

## Reddit Account Strategy (If New Account)

**If your account is new/low karma:**

**Option 1: Use an existing account**
- Ask a friend with established Reddit account to post
- You write it, they submit it
- They handle replies (or you reply from your account)

**Option 2: Build karma first (3-5 days)**
Day 1-2: Comment on popular posts in r/AskReddit, r/funny
Day 3-4: Comment in target subreddits (helpful, not promotional)
Day 5: Post using formats above

**Option 3: Post in smaller subreddits first**
- r/SideProject (friendlier to makers)
- r/alphaandbetausers (for feedback)
- r/macapps, r/webdev (smaller, more targeted)

---

## Emergency: If You Get Banned

**Don't:**
- Create new account immediately (they track IP/device)
- Argue with mods
- Post the same content again

**Do:**
- Appeal the ban (politely)
- Wait 1-2 weeks
- Build karma on new account before posting
- Change your approach (more value, less promotion)
