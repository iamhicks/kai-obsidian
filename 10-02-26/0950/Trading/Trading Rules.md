## 🎯 Core Model

**Base:** TTrades Fractal Model
**Enhanced by:** GxT Universal Model

**Key Addition:** GxT builds on Fractal Model with:
- 4 Hour timeframe inclusion
- 2-stage crack confluence
- SMT (Smart Money Tool) correlation
- PSP (Precision Swing Point)

---

## ⏰ TIMEFRAME HIERARCHY (Fractal Approach)

### Daily (HTF Bias)
- Establish daily bias/direction
- Identify key levels (old highs/lows, FVGs)

### 4 Hour (C2/C3 Setup)
- **IDEAL:** Trade the 4H C3
- **ACCEPTABLE:** Trade the 4H C2
- Look for swing point at key level (old high/low, FVG)
- Establishes high/low of day

### 1 Hour or 30 Minute (Order Flow)
- Establish daily order flow
- Look for C3 within the 4H C2/C3
- **CISD** = Change In State of Delivery (structure shift)

### 5 Minute or 3 Minute (Entry)
- Final entry timeframe
- Must confirm with CISD
- Entry trigger inside the 1H/30M C3

### The Fractal Stack:
```
Daily (Bias)
  → 4H C2/C3 (Swing point at key level)
    → 1H/30M C3 (Order flow)
      → 5M/3M CISD (Entry)
```

## ✅ ENTRY CRITERIA (Checklist)

### HTF Alignment (Daily):
- [ ] Daily bias identified (bullish/bearish)
- [ ] Key level marked (old high/low, FVG, OB)

### 4 Hour (The Setup):
- [ ] C2 or C3 at key level
- [ ] Prefer C3 over C2
- [ ] Swing point established

### 1H/30M (Order Flow):
- [ ] C3 formed
- [ ] CISD confirmed (structure shift)
- [ ] Daily order flow aligned

### 5M/3M (The Entry):
- [ ] CISD on entry timeframe
- [ ] Price at key level
- [ ] Entry trigger present

### Risk Management:
- [ ] Risk ≤ 1% of account
- [ ] Target ≥ 2% (1:2 R:R minimum)
- [ ] Stop loss logical (below/above structure)

### GxT Confluence (Optional but preferred):
- [ ] 2-stage crack present
- [ ] SMT correlation
- [ ] PSP alignment

## 🚫 FILTERS (NO TRADE When)

- [ ] No clear daily bias
- [ ] No 4H C2/C3 at key level
- [ ] No CISD confirmation
- [ ] Price mid-range (no key level)
- [ ] High-impact news within 30 minutes
- [ ] Already hit daily loss limit
- [ ] Emotional state compromised
- [ ] Family needs attention

## 📊 Key Sessions (EST Timezone)

| Time (EST) | Session | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 02:00 | London Open | Daily bias check, key levels |
| 08:30 | NY Open | Order flow, CISD confirmation |
| 13:30 | NY PM | *[Pete's primary trading window]* |

**Pete's Timezone:** London (GMT/EST+5)
- 02:00 EST = 07:00 GMT
- 08:30 EST = 13:30 GMT (US Market Open)

## 📚 Key Concepts

**C2/C3:** Candle 2 / Candle 3 closures (TTrades)
- C2 = Second candle after structure break
- C3 = Third candle (higher probability)

**CISD:** Change In State of Delivery
- Structure shift confirmation
- Lower timeframe validates higher timeframe

**FVG:** Fair Value Gap
- Imbalance in price
- Can become support/resistance

**OB:** Order Block
- Institutional order zone
- Takes priority over FVG (OB > FVG)

**SMT:** Smart Money Tool
- Correlation/divergence between correlated assets
- GxT addition

**PSP:** Precision Swing Point
- Refined swing point identification
- GxT addition

**2-Stage Crack:**
- Price breaking through levels in stages
- GxT confluence element
