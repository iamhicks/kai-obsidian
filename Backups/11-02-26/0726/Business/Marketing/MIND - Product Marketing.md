## Objections & Responses

**"$29 seems expensive for a notes app."**
"It's $29 once, not $10/month forever. Break-even vs Notion is 3 months. After that, you're saving money every month."

**"What if you stop updating it?"**
"You own it forever. It works today, it'll work in 10 years. No subscription = no risk of losing access."

**"Does it sync between devices?"**
"Not built-in (privacy first!), but you can use any sync you trust: Dropbox, iCloud, Syncthing, or just export/import."

**"Is it as powerful as Notion?"**
"For personal knowledge management? Yes. For databases and collaboration? No — and that's intentional. We focused on what 90% of people actually need."
