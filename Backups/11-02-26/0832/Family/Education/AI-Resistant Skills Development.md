## 3. Complex Problem Solving

**Why AI Can't Replace This:**
AI solves defined problems. Humans define which problems are worth solving.

### How to Develop

**Open-Ended Challenges (Not Worksheets)**
- "How can we build a bridge for this toy car?"
- "We're out of sugar—what can we use instead?"
- "Design a better way to organize your toys"

**Real Problems**
- Involve her in household decisions
- "Should we get a pet? Let's research together"
- "How can we help grandma?"
- Community problems she can contribute to

**Failure as Learning**
- Celebrate attempts, not just success
- "That didn't work. What could we try differently?"
- Model your own problem-solving (think aloud)

**Interdisciplinary Thinking**
- Problems that combine multiple domains
- Science + art
- Math + storytelling
- Technology + ethics

### Framework to Teach

**The Problem-Solving Cycle:**
1. **Notice** (recognize there's a problem)
2. **Define** (what exactly is the issue?)
3. **Ideate** (brainstorm solutions)
4. **Test** (try one approach)
5. **Reflect** (what worked? what didn't?)
6. **Iterate** (try again differently)

**This loop works for everything from LEGO towers to life decisions.**
