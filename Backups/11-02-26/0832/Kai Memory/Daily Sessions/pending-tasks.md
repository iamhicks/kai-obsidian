# Pending Tasks

## End of Week Reminders (Feb 13, 2026)

### 1. Cleanup Deprecated Website Folders
**Priority:** Medium  
**Why:** Website repo has old demo folders that should be removed now that new structure exists

**Folders to remove from `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/website/`:**
- `mind-demo/` → Now lives in `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/demo/`
- `mind/` → Empty folder
- `mind-tauri/` → Now lives in `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/app/`
- `flow-demo/` → Now lives in `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/flow/demo/`
- `flow/` → Empty folder

**Keep in website/:**
- `index.html` (homepage)
- `about/` (about page)
- `mission-control/` (dashboard)
- `CNAME` (domain config)
- `edge-demo/` (until EDGE gets proper repo)

**Note:** Only remove after verifying new structure works and backups are current.
