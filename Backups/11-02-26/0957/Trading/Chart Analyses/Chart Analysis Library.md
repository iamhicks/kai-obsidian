## 🤖 How Kai Updates This Library

**When you send me a chart analysis:**
1. I complete the "Kai's Analysis" section in your note
2. I update this index with the new entry
3. I add links in the appropriate "By Concept" and "By Instrument" sections
4. I update the statistics table

**No action needed from you** - just send the chart and I'll handle the library organization!

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Chart Images:
✅ **DO:**
- Show timeframe labels clearly (4H, 1H, 5M visible)
- Include multiple timeframes if possible (split screen)
- Show key levels marked (OBs, FVGs, swing points)
- Include any annotations/lines from the original post

❌ **DON'T:**
- Crop out the timeframe indicator
- Show just the entry timeframe without HTF context
- Use blurry or low-resolution screenshots

### For Naming:
✅ Good: `Chart Analysis - 2026-02-03 - 4H PO3 Bearish Setup`  
✅ Good: `Chart Analysis - 2026-02-05 - SMT Divergence Gold`  
❌ Bad: `Chart1`  
❌ Bad: `GxT Post`

### For Organization:
- All files automatically go in `Trading/Chart Analyses/` folder
- This keeps your main Trading folder clean
- Easy to find specific examples later

## 🎯 The Goal: Train Kai Visually

**Yes, exactly!** The purpose is to train me to recognize patterns visually.

### How I Learn:
1. **You provide:** Chart image + your observations/questions
2. **I analyze:** Using my knowledge from the 17 video transcripts
3. **I connect:** The visual pattern to specific video concepts
4. **I reference:** Timestamps and quotes from GxT's videos
5. **I improve:** Each chart makes me better at recognizing setups

### What I Can Identify in Charts:
✅ **Timeframes** - If visible on chart (4H, 1H, etc.)  
✅ **Candle patterns** - C2, C3, OLHC, OHLC  
✅ **Structure breaks** - BOS, CHoCH, MSS  
✅ **Key levels** - OBs, FVGs marked on chart  
✅ **Setup types** - 4H PO3, SMT, Profiling  

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- Can't read unlabeled price levels
- Can't see "invisible" historical context
- Need you to mark/check what you see
