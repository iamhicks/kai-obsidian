# Cold Start Marketing Plan — Starting From Zero

**Situation:** No email list, no existing audience, no social media following.

**Goal:** Build from zero to profitable launch.

---

## The Reality Check

**Without an existing audience:**
- Product Hunt launch will be harder (no initial upvote base)
- Email sequences won't work (no list)
- Organic X posts reach nobody initially
- Cold traffic costs money

**But we have advantages:**
- Great product with unique positioning
- Strong messaging (privacy, offline, one-time purchase)
- Demo that sells itself
- Gumroad handles distribution

---

## Revised Strategy: Distribution First

### Phase 1: Build Distribution (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Get in front of people who already have audiences.

#### 1. Borrow Other People's Audiences

**Reddit (Zero Cost, Immediate Reach)**
- r/selfhosted (250K members)
- r/privacy (1.6M members)  
- r/IndieHackers (180K members)
- r/productivity (2.3M members)

**Strategy:**
- Week 1: "I'm building an offline-first notes app, what features matter?" (feedback post)
- Week 2: "Show HN: MIND — a notes app that works offline, $29 once" (launch post)
- Week 3-4: Educational posts, "How I reduced my software spend by $2K/year"

**Reddit success formula:**
- Provide value first
- Be genuinely helpful
- Mention product only when relevant
- Don't be promotional
- Engage in comments

**Target:** 50-100 upvotes per post = thousands of views

**Product Hunt (Leverage Their Audience)**
- Create "Coming Soon" page immediately
- Share on personal networks (even small)
- Cold outreach: Ask 10 friends to follow the page
- On launch day: Post to every relevant Slack/Discord
- Engage with EVERY comment

**Target:** Even without audience, good product can hit top 10

#### 2. Cold Outreach to Micro-Influencers

**Target:** 10-20 micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) in productivity/privacy space

**Message template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I follow your work on [specific thing]. Really resonates with me.

I just built MIND — a privacy-first notes app (offline, $29 once, no subscriptions).

Think it might interest your audience. Happy to give you free access or do an affiliate deal (30% commission).

Either way, keep up the great work.

[Your name]
```

**Goal:** 2-3 micro-influencers share it = instant credibility + traffic

#### 3. Guest Content

**Target blogs/newsletters:**
- Ness Labs (productive flourishing)
- Forte Labs (building a second brain)
- RadReads (productive lifestyle)
- Indie Hackers newsletter
- Privacy-focused newsletters

**Pitch:** "How I built a $X/month business selling privacy-first tools" or "Why I'm done with subscription software"

**Goal:** 1 guest post = 1,000-5,000 targeted views

---

### Phase 2: Build Your Own Audience (Weeks 4-12)

**Now that you have traffic, capture it.**

#### 1. Email List Building (Priority #1)

**Opt-in on website:**
- "Get 30% off launch day — join the list"
- "Free guide: Privacy-first productivity setup"
- "Weekly productivity tips + app updates"

**Goal:** 10-20 email signups/day from organic traffic

**Tools:** Gumroad has built-in email, or ConvertKit free tier

#### 2. X/Twitter From Zero

**The cold start strategy:**

**Weeks 1-2: Lurk and engage**
- Follow 50 accounts in your niche
- Reply thoughtfully to their posts
- Don't post yet, just build relationships

**Weeks 3-4: Start posting**
- Post 1x daily (building in public)
- Quote-tweet bigger accounts with value-add
- Reply to every comment
- Share Reddit/PH success stories

**Weeks 5-12: Scale**
- 2x daily posts
- Weekly threads
- Collaborate with people you engaged with early

**Target:** 1,000 followers by month 3

#### 3. YouTube (Long-term Play)

**Start immediately:**
- "MIND vs Notion — honest comparison"
- "How to organize your life offline"
- "Why I stopped paying for productivity apps"

**Post 1x/week, every week**
- Even if views are tiny at first
- YouTube is a long game
- Videos rank for years

**Target:** 100 subscribers by month 3 (small but real)

---

### Phase 3: Paid Acquisition (Month 2-3)

**Once you have:**
- Email list (500+)
- Proven conversion (people are buying)
- Cash flow (reinvesting revenue)

**Then start paid:**

#### Reddit Ads
- Target r/productivity, r/selfhosted
- "Tired of subscription software?"
- Drive to demo, not sales page
- Budget: $5-10/day to start

#### X Ads
- Target followers of: @levelsio, @arvidkahl, @dvassallo
- "Stop renting your notes"
- Drive to demo
- Budget: $10-20/day

**Rule:** Don't spend on ads until you know your conversion rate from organic traffic.

## What Changes Without An Audience

### What We DO More Of:
1. **Reddit** — Immediate distribution, no following needed
2. **Guest posts** — Borrow other people's audiences
3. **Cold outreach** — Manual hustle to get first users
4. **Building in public** — Document journey, attract followers
5. **Paid ads (later)** — Buy distribution when ready

### What We DO Less Of:
1. Email marketing (until we have a list)
2. Product Hunt relying on followers
3. X organic expecting reach
4. Launching to "existing customers"

### What Stays The Same:
1. Great product positioning
2. Strong messaging
3. Demo experience
4. Pricing strategy
5. Long-term content

## Realistic Cold Start Targets

| Month | Sales | Revenue | Emails | X Followers | Focus |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 30 | $1,000 | 100 | 100 | Reddit, cold outreach |
| 2 | 70 | $2,500 | 300 | 500 | Guest posts, content |
| 3 | 150 | $5,000 | 600 | 1,000 | PH launch, ads |
| 6 | 400 | $15,000 | 1,500 | 3,000 | Scale what's working |
| 12 | 1,200 | $50,000 | 3,000 | 8,000 | Full marketing machine |

**Year 1 Revenue (Realistic): $50,000**

Lower than the $92K original target, but achievable from zero.

**Year 2 Revenue (With audience): $100,000+**

Once you have the list and following, growth compounds.
