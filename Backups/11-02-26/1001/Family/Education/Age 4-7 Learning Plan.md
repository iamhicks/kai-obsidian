## Bilingual Strategy (Critical)

**Mealtime Language**

- Dinner: Both

**Nature Vocabulary**
- When outside, name things in both languages
- "Look, a bird! Птица!"
- Don't force repetition, just natural exposure

**Russian Media (Limited, High Quality)**
- 20-30 min/day maximum
- Союзмультфильм classics (cheburashka, crocodile Gena)
- Russian children's songs on Spotify
- Audio stories in Russian

## Academic Readiness (Light Touch)

### Pre-Reading (Through Play)
- **Read aloud 30+ min daily** (most important!)
- Environmental print (signs, labels)
- Letter recognition through play (not drilling)
- Rhyming games
- Story sequencing ("What happened first?")

### Pre-Math (Through Play)
- Counting in daily life (stairs, grapes, blocks)
- Sorting and classifying (by color, size, type)
- Patterns (beads, blocks)
- Cooking together (measurements)
- Board games (simple ones)

### Writing Readiness
- Fine motor activities (playdough, cutting, beading)
- Drawing and scribbling (valuable!)
- Sand/salt tray letter drawing
- Not formal writing yet

**Rule:** If she's not interested, back off. There's plenty of time.

---

## AI Preparation (Subtle)

### Don't:
- Teach her to code at age 4
- Push screen-based learning
- Worry about "keeping up"

### Do:
- Model using AI tools as aids ("Alexa, how do you say 'apple' in Russian?")
- Show that technology is a tool, not a replacement for thinking
- Emphasize human creativity (art, music, storytelling)
- Build critical thinking (ask "Why?" and "What do you think?")

### Conversation Starters
- "What do you think will happen if...?"
- "Why do you think the character felt sad?"
- "How could we solve this problem?"
- "What would you create if you could make anything?"
