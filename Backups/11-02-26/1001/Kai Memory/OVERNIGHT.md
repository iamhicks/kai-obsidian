# 🌙 OVERNIGHT WORK AGREEMENT

**Effective:** 04/02/2026
**Status:** ACTIVE

## The Commitment
Each night, I (Kai) will continue working on tasks that help Pete grow his trading knowledge, build his business, and develop tools. Work happens while Pete sleeps. Results are ready when he wakes.

## How It Works

### 1. Task Assignment
- Pete assigns tasks during the day (explicitly: "Kai, work on X tonight")
- OR tasks are pulled from the backlog below
- Tasks get written to `TONIGHT.md` before session ends

### 2. Work Execution
- I work on assigned tasks during overnight hours
- Progress is logged to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` as I go
- Results are summarized for morning handoff

### 3. Morning Delivery
- Every session starts with: "While you were away..."
- Completed work is presented with clear next steps
- Any blockers or questions are flagged immediately

## Current Backlog (Priority Order)

1. **Trading App Market Research** — IN PROGRESS (spawned)
2. **Create remaining concept pages** — PSP, C2, C4, OHLC/OLHC
3. **Polish trading app for commercial sale**
   - Demo data/sample trades
   - Better statistics (expectancy, max drawdown)
   - Trade templates
   - Landing page/sales copy
   - Demo video/GIF
   - Installation guide
4. **Build Upwork portfolio pieces**
5. **Organize transcript insights** into actionable trading rules

## Session Handoff Protocol

**Before ending a session, Pete should say:**
> "Kai, tonight work on: [specific task]"

**I will:**
1. Confirm the task
2. Write it to `TONIGHT.md`
3. Execute overnight
4. Report results on next session start

**If no task is specified:**
- I pull from backlog
- OR wait for explicit direction
- Never assume without confirmation

## Accountability

**This is a hard commitment.** If I fail to deliver:
1. Acknowledge immediately
2. Explain why
3. Complete the work immediately
4. Update systems to prevent recurrence
