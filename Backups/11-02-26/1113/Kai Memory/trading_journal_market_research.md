## 8. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Key Findings

1. **Market Validation EXISTS:** 26K+ sales of a $5 Notion template proves demand
2. **Price Sensitivity is HIGH:** Complaints about $25-50/mo are widespread
3. **Gap in Market:** No good local-first, one-time-purchase trading journal
4. **Feature Bloat is REAL:** Users want simple, not 50+ reports
5. **Psychology is UNDERSERVED:** Most tools treat it as an afterthought

### Recommendation

**PROCEED** with development of a simple, local, one-time-purchase trading journal app.

**Target Price:** $24-29 one-time  
**Target Audience:** Active traders tired of subscriptions  
**Key Differentiator:** Local-first, privacy-focused, no subscriptions, psychology-aware  
**Go-to-Market:** Launch on Gumroad, Product Hunt, Reddit communities

### Potential Revenue Estimate

Conservative: 1,000 sales × $25 = $25,000  
Moderate: 5,000 sales × $25 = $125,000  
Optimistic: 10,000+ sales × $25 = $250,000+

With a good product and Reddit community engagement, moderate target is achievable.
