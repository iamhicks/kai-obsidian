# Session: 10-02-2026 Evening - MIND Electron Pivot

## What We Did

### Goal
Get MIND desktop app working with native Ollama integration and polished UI.

### Pivot Decision
After 3+ hours fighting Tauri UI bugs, **pivoted to Electron** per ORDER 13.

### Progress
- ✅ **Electron app running** — Full Chromium, UI matches web exactly
- ✅ **Ollama proxy** — `/ollama` endpoint bypasses CORS
- ✅ **AI working** — Tags, summary, text improvements
- ✅ **5 bugs fixed** — Search HTML, + button, checkbox center, version history
- ✅ **Documentation** — Created MIND Technical Specification.md

### Technical Approach (Final)
**Electron + Express proxy:**
1. Electron loads local HTML file
2. Express server runs on localhost:9876
3. `/ollama` proxies to `localhost:11434` (no CORS)
4. UI is identical to web demo

### Key Lesson
**Should have suggested Electron immediately** when Tauri UI broke. Sunk cost kept me trying to fix Tauri for hours when Electron was the obvious solution.

### Files Changed
- `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind-electron/` — New Electron app
- `STANDING_ORDERS.md` — Added ORDER 13 (pause when stuck)
- `Kai_Obsidian/Kai/MIND Technical Specification.md` — Product documentation

### Status
**Ready for testing.** Electron app with polished UI and working Ollama.

## Key Takeaway
When stuck: **PAUSE and suggest alternatives.** Don't let sunk cost drive decisions.
