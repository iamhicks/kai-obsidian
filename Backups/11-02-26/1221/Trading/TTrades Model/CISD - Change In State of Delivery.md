## 🎯 What is CISD?

**CISD = Change In State of Delivery**

A structure shift confirmation on a lower timeframe that validates the higher timeframe narrative. It's the **green light** that tells you the setup is playing out and it's safe to enter.

**Simple Definition:** Price breaking structure (previous high/low) and closing beyond it, confirming direction.

---

## 🔄 How CISD Works

### **The Concept:**
1. Higher timeframe shows setup (4H C3 forming)
2. Lower timeframe shows structure (1H/30M)
3. Price breaks that structure
4. **CISD confirmed** → Entry timing validated

### **Visual Example (Bullish):**
```
Price makes low → Bounces → Closes above previous down-candles
                    ↑
              CISD CONFIRMED
```

## ✅ Why CISD is Critical

**Without CISD:**
- Entering blindly
- No confirmation of momentum
- Higher chance of false break
- Poor timing

**With CISD:**
- Confirms trend shift
- Validates HTF narrative
- Precise entry timing
- Defined invalidation

> *"We want to see a close over that series of down close candles. That means we can be looking for continuations."* - TTrades

## 🔍 How to Identify CISD

### **Bullish CISD:**

**What to Look For:**
1. Series of down-close candles making lows
2. Price consolidates or forms base
3. **Close above those down-close candles**
4. New protected swing established

**Step by Step:**
1. Mark the series of candles that made the low
2. Draw line at highest close of that series
3. Wait for price to close above that line
4. **That's CISD**

**Example:**
- Candles 1-3: Down closes (4810, 4805, 4800)
- Candle 4: Closes at 4815
- **CISD confirmed at 4815** ✅

### **Bearish CISD:**

**What to Look For:**
1. Series of up-close candles making highs
2. Price consolidates or forms top
3. **Close below those up-close candles**
4. New protected swing established

## 📊 CISD in Pete's Model

### **Timeframe Hierarchy:**

```
4H (Setup - C3 forming)
    ↓
1H/30M (CISD Confirmation)
    ↓
5M/3M (Entry Execution)
```

### **The Flow:**

**Step 1:** 4H shows C3 setup
- Bullish reversal candle on C2
- C3 starting to form
- Price at key level (OB/FVG)

**Step 2:** Drop to 1H/30M
- Look for CISD confirmation
- Mark series of down-close candles
- Wait for close above

**Step 3:** CISD Confirmed
- Structure broken
- Protected swing established
- Now drop to 5M for entry

**Step 4:** 5M Entry
- Entry on breakout or retest
- Stop below protected swing
- Target 1:2 R:R

## 🎯 CISD + Protected Swing

### **Protected Swing Definition:**
A swing point (high or low) that holds and isn't broken. Used for:
- CISD confirmation reference
- Stop loss placement
- Invalidation point

### **How They Work Together:**

1. **Price makes new low**
   - Series of down-close candles
   - This is the swing being tested

2. **Price reverses**
   - Starts closing higher
   - Forms potential new swing

3. **CISD occurs**
   - Close above down-close series
   - **New protected swing established**

4. **Trade entry**
   - Stop below new protected swing
   - Trade continues in CISD direction

> *"Marking out the new low. Where is our series of down close candles? Let's see if we can get a close over that."*

## 📈 CISD Trade Example (From Transcript)

**Setup: Bullish Continuation on 1H**

**Context:**
- 4H shows C3 bullish forming
- Daily bias bullish
- Price at key support

**1H Action:**
1. Price makes low at 4800
2. Three down-close candles: 4810 → 4805 → 4800
3. Price consolidates
4. Next candle closes at 4815

**CISD Confirmed:** ✅
- Close above series (4815 > 4810)
- New protected swing: 4800 low
- Entry on next candle
- Stop: 4795 (below 4800)
- Target: 4855 (1:2 R:R)

**Result:** Trade hits target ✅

## ⚠️ CISD Red Flags

**Weak CISD (Avoid):**
- Close barely above/below series
- Large wick rejecting direction
- Low volume
- Immediately retraces

**Strong CISD (Trade):**
- Clear close beyond series
- Small wick in direction
- Momentum candle
- Holds on retest

## 🔄 CISD vs Structure Break

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Structure Break** | Price breaks previous high/low | General term |
| **CISD** | Close beyond series of candles | Specific confirmation |
| **BOS** | Break of Structure | ICT term |
| **CHoCH** | Change of Character | Trend change |
| **MSS** | Market Structure Shift | Major shift |

**CISD is the specific TTrades term for the confirming close.**

## 🎯 CISD Checklist

**Before Considering Entry:**

- [ ] **4H setup valid** - C2/C3 forming
- [ ] **Daily bias aligned** - Not fighting HTF
- [ ] **1H/30M structure clear** - Series of candles visible
- [ ] **CISD occurred** - Close beyond series
- [ ] **Protected swing established** - Stop placement logical
- [ ] **5M entry trigger** - Precise timing
- [ ] **Risk:Reward 1:2+** - Worth the trade

## 💡 Pro Tips

**1. Wait for the Close**
- Don't enter on wick
- Wait for candle to close
- Confirms true intent

**2. Multiple Timeframes**
- 1H CISD = Good
- 30M CISD confirming = Better
- Both aligned = Best

**3. Context Matters**
- CISD at key level = Strong
- CISD mid-range = Weak
- CISD with OB/FVG = Best

**4. Don't Chase**
- Missed CISD = Wait for next
- Don't enter late
- Next setup always coming

## 🔗 Connection to GxT Model

**GxT Uses Similar Concept:**
- "Structure shift confirmation"
- "Lower timeframe validation"
- "Phase confirmation"

**Both Models Agree:**
- Never enter without LTF confirmation
- CISD/structure break is minimum requirement
- Protects against false breaks

> *"We want to see a close over that series of down close candles. That means we can be looking for continuations."*

> *"Marking out the new low. Where is our series of down close candles? Let's see if we can get a close over that."*

> *"And there we get the close over. So then I could take a long setup on the open of this new candle, my stop on the protected low."*

> *"With a large wick like this I'm going to want to let this candle close. Once this candle closes back inside of the range of its previous, we have confirmation."*

## 🚀 Practice Exercise

**On Your Charts:**
1. Find recent 4H setups
2. Drop to 1H and mark down-close series
3. Identify where CISD occurred
4. Check if entry after CISD was profitable
5. Track: Entries with CISD vs without

**Expected Result:** CISD-confirmed entries should have higher win rate.
