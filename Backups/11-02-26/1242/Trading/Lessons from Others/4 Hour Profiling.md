# 4 Hour Profiling

A 4H profile is just a market profile on 4-hour candles instead of daily ones. It gives a sharper view of intraday bias.

## The Main 4H Profile Types

- London Reversal
- New York Continuation
- New York Reversal
- Asia Reversal

## London Reversal Profile

In a London Reversal profile, Asia consolidates or retraces. London then manipulates or reverses. New York expands.

**Timeline:**
- 2am London manipulation
- 6am New York continuation

## New York Continuation Profile

In a New York Continuation profile, London often sets the daily high or low.

**Timeline:**
- 2am/6am → Manipulation
- 6am/10am → Continuation

As long as there's a DOL (Draw On Liquidity) open for the 10am candle, you can look to trade the continuation.

## New York Reversal Profile

In a New York Reversal profile, NY sets the daily high or low.

**Timeline:**
- 6am/10am → Manipulation
- 10am/2pm → Continuation

## Asia Reversal Profile

When Asia expands in one direction, it can move fast. But don't expect the whole day to only expand — the daily high or low often forms during the 6am or 10am (4H) candle.

**Timeline:**
- 6pm/10pm → Manipulation
- 10pm/2am/6am → Continuation

**Key Takeaways from the summary:**
- **Goal:** Align 4H expansion candles in one direction
- **Focus on:** Highs/Lows, FVGs, Order Blocks
- **Trade within expansion candles** — skip retracement ones
- **If current candle doesn't support expansion → wait for next setup**

## 🔗 Connections to Pete's Model

This 4H profiling concept connects directly to your trading model:

**Session Timing for Your 4H C3 Setups:**
- [[../TTrades Model/C3 - Candle 3 Confirmation]] - Use 4H profiling to time when your C3 setups are most likely to play out
- [[../TTrades Model/CISD - Change In State of Delivery]] - Confirm CISD during expansion candles (London 6am, NY 10am), skip during manipulation/retracement candles
- [[../Trading Rules/Pete's Trading Rules - Unified Model]] - Add session-based timing filters to your entry checklist

**Trading Hours for Your Model:**
- **You trade NY session (13:30 GMT open)** = Look for NY Continuation or NY Reversal profiles
- **Daughter home after 13:30 GMT** = Focus on pre-structured setups with 4H bias confirmed before entry

**Key Integration:**
- 4H C3 formation time matters - C3 forming at 6am vs 10am vs 2pm has different implications
- Combine with your Daily bias → 4H C3 → 1H CISD hierarchy
- Use 4H profiling to predict which session will produce the C3 continuation move
