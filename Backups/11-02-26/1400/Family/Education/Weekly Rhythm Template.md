# Weekly Rhythm Template

## A Flexible Framework

This is a template, not a rigid schedule.
**Flexibility is key.** Some days will flow differently.

## Core Principles

1. **Rhythm over schedule** — predictable patterns, not exact times
2. **Bilingual immersion** — both languages every day
3. **Play first** — academics come naturally through play
4. **Outdoors daily** — nature is essential
5. **Social connection** — time with other children
6. **Your sanity matters** — sustainable for the whole family
