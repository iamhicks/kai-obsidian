---

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY

**Trade the Fractal. Master the Model.**

This model combines the systematic approach of TTrades Fractal Model with the advanced confluence factors of GxT Universal Model. It prioritizes high-probability setups through multi-timeframe alignment and strict risk management.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Proactivity** - Don't chase, wait for setups
2. **Patience** - C3 over C2, confirmation over prediction
3. **Discipline** - Follow the checklist every time
4. **Risk First** - Protect capital, profits follow

## ⏰ TIMEFRAME HIERARCHY (FRACTAL MODEL)

```
DAILY (HTF Bias)
    ↓
4H (Setup - C2/C3 Identification)
    ↓
1H/30M (Confirmation - CISD)
    ↓
5M/3M (Entry Execution)
```

### **1. DAILY - The Filter (07:00 GMT)**
**Purpose:** Establish directional bias for the day

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify Daily structure (bullish/bearish)
- [ ] Mark previous day high/low
- [ ] Note any Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
- [ ] Identify Order Blocks (OBs)
- [ ] **Only trade in direction of Daily bias**

**Rule:** If Daily is bearish, only look for shorts. Never trade against Daily bias.

---

### **2. 4H - The Setup (Primary Trading Timeframe)**
**Purpose:** Identify C2/C3 formations at key levels

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Price at key level (OB, FVG, previous high/low)
- [ ] C2 or C3 forming
- [ ] **Prefer C3 over C2** (higher probability)
- [ ] OHLC/OLHC profiling visible
- [ ] Room for move (not already at target)

**C3 Identification:**
- First candle after structure break = C1
- Second candle = C2 (reversal or consolidation)
- Third candle = **C3 (trade this continuation)**

**Wick Analysis:**
- Small wick = Supports expansion ✅
- Large wick = Indecision, wait ⚠️

**Rule:** Never trade C2 unless it has small wick + CISD. Prefer C3 always.

---

### **2B. 4H PROFILING - Session Timing Enhancement**
**Purpose:** Time your C3 entries with session expansion phases for higher probability

**Learned from:** [[../../Lessons from others/4 Hour Profiling]]

**The Four Profile Types:**

| Profile | When It Happens | Your Trading Window | Action |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **London Reversal** | 2am manipulation → 6am continuation | 6am-10am EST | Trade C3 during NY continuation |
| **NY Continuation** | London sets HOD/LOD | 6am-10am EST | Trade C3 in direction of London |
| **NY Reversal** | 6am/10am manipulation | 10am-2pm EST | Wait for C2 reversal, trade C3 |
| **Asia Reversal** | Asia expands first | 6pm-6am EST | Usually before your trading time |

**For Your Schedule (13:30 GMT = 8:30 EST):**

**Best Setup:**
- 4H C3 forming by 6am EST
- You confirm CISD at 8:30am EST
- Trade NY continuation to 10am-2pm EST

**Avoid:**
- C3 forming during manipulation phase (2am, 6am if reversal pattern)
- Entering during retracement candles
- Fighting the 4H profile type

**Quick Check:**
- Is this an expansion candle or manipulation/retracement candle?
- Expansion = Trade
- Manipulation/Retracement = Wait for next setup

---

### **3. 1H/30M - Confirmation (CISD)**
**Purpose:** Validate 4H setup with structure shift

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Series of candles in setup direction
- [ ] **CISD occurred** (close beyond series)
- [ ] Protected swing established
- [ ] Order flow aligned with 4H
- [ ] No conflicting signals

**CISD Confirmation:**
- Bullish: Close above series of down-close candles
- Bearish: Close below series of up-close candles

**Rule:** No CISD = No entry. Period.

---

### **4. 5M/3M - Entry Execution**
**Purpose:** Precise entry with minimal risk

**Checklist:**
- [ ] CISD confirmed on 5M/3M
- [ ] Entry trigger clear (breakout, retest, etc.)
- [ ] Stop loss logical (below/above protected swing)
- [ ] Target gives minimum 1:2 R:R
- [ ] Position size calculated (1% max risk)

**Entry Types:**
- Aggressive: Market order on CISD
- Conservative: Limit order on retest of broken level

**Rule:** If R:R < 1:2, skip the trade.

## 💰 RISK MANAGEMENT

### **Hard Rules (Never Break):**

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Risk per trade** | 1% of account | Maximum, can be less |
| **Target per trade** | 2% of account | Minimum, can be more |
| **Minimum R:R** | 1:2 | Non-negotiable |
| **Max daily loss** | 3% of account | Walk away after this |
| **Max trades per day** | 3-5 | Quality over quantity |
| **Max weekly loss** | 6% of account | Protect capital |

### **Position Sizing Formula:**

```
Position Size = (Account Balance × 0.01) ÷ (Entry - Stop Loss)

Example:
- Account: $10,000
- 1% risk = $100
- Entry: 4800
- Stop: 4780 (20 points)
- Position Size = $100 ÷ 20 points = $5 per point
```

### **Stop Loss Placement:**

**Long Trades:**
- Stop below protected swing low
- Give 10-20 points buffer
- Never widen stop once set

**Short Trades:**
- Stop above protected swing high
- Give 10-20 points buffer
- Never widen stop once set

**Rule:** Stop loss is your invalidation point. If hit, you were wrong. Accept it.

### **Target Placement:**

**Primary Target:** External Range Liquidity (ERL)
- Previous major high/low
- Fair Value Gap beyond current price
- Order Block in direction of trade
- Projection levels

**Partial Profits:**
- Take 50% off at 1:1 R:R (breakeven on runner)
- Let 50% run to 1:2 or beyond
- Trail stop to breakeven once 1:1 reached
