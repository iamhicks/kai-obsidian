## Email Body

### Subject: The trading journal I've been building (finally ready)

Hey [Name],

I've spent the last month building something I wish I had when I started trading seriously.

**Trading Journal Pro — Fractal Model Edition**

It's a local-first, psychology-focused trading journal built specifically for traders following the TTrades Fractal Model and GxT Universal Model.

**The problem it solves:**
- ❌ Most journals are $25-50/month subscriptions
- ❌ They store your data in the cloud (privacy risk)
- ❌ They're bloated with features you don't need
- ❌ They ignore psychology — the #1 factor in trading results

**This one's different:**
✅ $24 one-time. Own it forever.
✅ Runs entirely on your computer (your data stays yours)
✅ Built-in templates for C2/C3, CISD, Protected Swings
✅ Psychology tracking: mood, discipline, emotions
✅ Log trades in under 10 seconds

**What traders are saying:**

> "Finally a journal that understands the Fractal Model." — Beta User

> "The psychology tracking revealed I lose 40% more when I sleep less than 6 hours." — Beta User
