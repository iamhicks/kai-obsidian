# Brand Identity & Values

## i_am_Hicks — "Define yourself"

---

## Our Name

**i_am_Hicks** — A declaration of identity. Not "Hicks Software" or "Hicks Apps." Just you. Claiming your space, your tools, your workflow.

The name puts the user first, always.

---

## Our Tagline

### **"Define yourself"**

Three words that capture everything we stand for:
- **Define** → Take control, structure your thoughts, build systems
- **Yourself** → Personal, customizable, yours alone
- The implied action: You're not waiting for permission. You're not fitting into someone else's mold.

---

## Mission

**To create tools that help people think clearly, work intentionally, and own their digital lives — without renting them from subscription-hungry corporations.**

We believe software should:
- Work when you need it (even offline)
- Respect your privacy (your data stays yours)
- Cost what it costs (one time, not forever)
- Last as long as you need it (no sunsetting for profit)

---

## Vision

**A world where people own their tools, their data, and their workflows.**

Where "productivity software" doesn't mean "monthly tax on your productivity."

Where apps are designed for humans first, investors second.

Where you buy software once and it just... works. For years.

---

## Core Values

### 1. **Ownership Over Access**
When you buy our software, you own it. Period. No subscriptions. No lock-in. No "your trial expired" popups. Your license, your device, your rules.

### 2. **Privacy by Design**
Your data never leaves your machine unless you choose to sync it. No analytics harvesting. No "we're improving your experience" data mining. What you create is yours alone.

### 3. **Offline-First**
The internet breaks. Servers go down. Companies get acquired and kill products. Our apps work whether you're on a plane, in a cabin, or the apocalypse just happened.

### 4. **Simplicity Without Sacrifice**
Clean, modern interfaces inspired by Notion and Linear. Powerful features hidden behind intuitive design. No bloat. No learning curve from hell.

### 5. **Fair Pricing**
One-time purchase. $29-99 depending on the app. Compare that to Notion ($10/mo), Evernote ($15/mo), or Superhuman ($30/mo). Use our apps for 3 months and you've paid for a lifetime.

### 6. **Cohesive Ecosystem**
Four apps that work together seamlessly. Same design language. Same shortcuts. Same philosophy. Switch between thinking (MIND), doing (ACTION), tracking (FLOW), and remembering (ECHO) without friction.

- **Knows their shit** — Competent, reliable, no-nonsense
- **Refuses to overcharge** — Fair, honest, anti-corporate
- **Values their privacy** — Paranoid in the healthy way, protective of their space

- **Hates subscriptions** — Once said "I'd rather pirate than rent Photoshop"

### Voice Characteristics

|-------|-----|-----|
| **Tone** | Confident but humble | Arrogant or apologetic |
| **Language** | Clear, direct, occasional wit | Jargony, buzzword-heavy, overly casual |
| **Confidence** | "This works because we built it right" | "We think this might help maybe?" |
| **Attitude** | Anti-corporate, pro-user | Whiny, bitter, victim mentality |
| **Humor** | Dry, smart, occasional edge | Dad jokes, memes, trying too hard |

### Words We Use
- Own, keep, yours, forever
- Build, create, define
- Clean, fast, simple
- One-time, lifetime, buy
- Private, local, offline
- Suite, ecosystem, connected

### Words We Avoid

- Synergy, leverage, optimize
- Disrupt, revolutionize, game-changer

## Why We Exist

### The Problem

Software has become a rental economy. You don't buy tools anymore — you lease them. And the lease terms keep getting worse:

- **Subscriptions everywhere** — $10 here, $15 there, $30 for email
- **Your data in their clouds** — One hack, one bankruptcy, one acquisition away from gone
- **Offline? Good luck** — Hope you remembered to sync before the flight
- **Feature bloat** — Every quarter, another popup for a feature you'll never use
- **Planned obsolescence** — Apps you loved get killed for "strategic reasons"

### The Breaking Point

Notion raised prices. Evernote imploded. Roam Research went sideways. Users are tired of:
- Exporting their data every 6 months "just in case"
- Explaining to their bank why they have 17 $10 charges
- Watching features they use get buried under features they don't

### Our Answer

**i_am_Hicks** — A suite of apps that work like software used to:
- Buy once, own forever
- Works offline, always
- Your data, your device, your business
- Clean, focused, fast
- Part of a coherent system, not isolated tools

### The Philosophy

We're not trying to "disrupt" productivity software. We're trying to **reclaim** it.

For the writers who want to think without WiFi.
For the developers who want notes that don't phone home.
For the freelancers tired of subscription math.
For the paranoid, the offline, the ownership-minded.

**Define yourself.**

Not your vendor. Not your subscription tier. You.

## Brand Promise

> **"Every i_am_Hicks app you buy becomes yours forever. No subscriptions. No surprises. No lock-in. Just tools that work — today, tomorrow, and ten years from now."**

## Visual Identity Notes

- **Primary Colors:** Deep navy (#1a1a2e), clean white (#ffffff), accent coral (#e94560)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif, generous whitespace, Notion-inspired layouts
- **Imagery:** Real people using real tools. No stock photo corporate nonsense.
- **Icons:** Minimal, geometric, consistent across all 4 apps
- **Screenshots:** Dark mode default (developers live in dark mode), clean UI shots, no clutter

## The 4-App Ecosystem

| App | Purpose | Price |
|-----|---------|-------|
| **MIND** | Second brain — notes, ideas, knowledge | $49 |
| **ACTION** | Task & project management | $39 |
| **FLOW** | Habits, tracking, metrics | $29 |
| **ECHO** | Bookmarks, reading, references | $39 |
| **BUNDLE** | All 4 apps | $99 (save $57) |

**Positioning:** The $99 bundle is the hero offer. Single apps are for specific use cases.

## Competitive Positioning

| | i_am_Hicks | Notion | Obsidian | Evernote |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pricing** | One-time $29-99 | $10-15/mo | Free/$8/mo sync | $15/mo |
| **Offline** | Native | Limited | Yes | Limited |
| **Privacy** | Local-first | Cloud | Local + optional | Cloud |
| **Subscription** | Never | Required | Optional | Required |
| **Ecosystem** | 4 integrated apps | All-in-one | Plugins | One app |

**Key differentiator:** We're the only ones combining true offline-first, local data, no subscriptions, AND a cohesive multi-app ecosystem.
