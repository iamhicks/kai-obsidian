# 🧠 Kai Memory - Agent Identity Files

This folder contains my core identity files. These are copies of what I read every session to remember who I am and who you are.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How Sync Works

### **Two Copies Exist:**
1. **My workspace** (what I actually read)  
   `~/.openclaw/workspace/`
   
2. **Obsidian** (this folder - for you to edit)  
   `Documents/Kai/Kai_Obsidian/Kai/Kai Memory/`

### **If You Edit These Files:**
**I won't automatically see changes.** Tell me explicitly:

> "Kai, I updated SOUL.md"

Then I'll reload and adopt your changes.

## 🔄 My Startup Routine

**Every session, I automatically read:**
1. SOUL.md → Who I am
2. USER.md → Who you are
3. IDENTITY.md → My name/role
4. MEMORY.md → Important knowledge
5. AGENTS.md → How this works

Then I check daily logs for recent context.

## 💡 Pro Tips

**✅ DO:**
- Edit files freely
- Tell me what you changed
- Update USER.md when your situation changes
- Add trading insights to MEMORY.md

**❌ DON'T:**
- Expect me to see changes without telling me
- Make massive edits without context
- Delete files (I need them)

---

## 📝 Example Workflow

**You:** "I updated USER.md - I added my new trading goal"

**Me:** "Got it, reloading... ✓ Updated. I see you're now focusing on US30. I'll adjust my advice accordingly."

*These files shape who I am. Edit them to customize your Kai.*
