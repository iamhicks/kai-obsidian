# Session Summary - 08-02-2026

**Date:** 08-02-2026  
**Duration:** 2+ hours  
**Focus:** Fix broken backups, restore MIND, create operational protocols  
**Outcome:** Success (after multiple fixes)

---

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Completed
- **Fixed backup mess** — MIND, FLOW, Website, Obsidian, OpenClaw all backing up correctly
- **Restored MIND to working version** — Commit 501d995 with AI integration and all bug fixes
- **Created STANDING_ORDERS.md** — 10 non-negotiable operational rules (log everything, verify first, etc.)
- **Created PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY.md** — Three-Strike, Scalpel, Ask Before Dig, Terse Output rules
- **Set up gateway watchdog** — Auto-restart monitoring with logging and notifications
- **Fixed sync-to-obsidian.sh** — Now includes STANDING_ORDERS and PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY
- **Updated AGENTS.md** — New read order includes protocol files

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- **MIND broken multiple times** — Restored wrong version from archive (Feb 6, too old), then wrong commit (missing fixes). Finally restored correct version 501d995.
- **GitHub Pages caching** — Deployed changes not appearing due to aggressive CDN cache. Added cache-busting headers.
- **Modular file split failed** — Attempted to split MIND into components, created stubs without full code. Reverted to single-file working version.
- **Backup script missing FLOW** — Updated backup-all.sh to include FLOW component.
- **Sync script missing protocols** — Added STANDING_ORDERS.md and PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY.md to sync.

### 🚫 Blocked/Deferred
- **FLOW modular split** — User said "not now"
- **Move website to better host** — Vercel/Netlify suggested to avoid GitHub Pages cache issues

## Technical Decisions

1. **Keep MIND as single file** — Modular split broke functionality. Single 7,355-line file is working.
2. **Use GitHub for version recovery** — Restored from specific commits (501d995) instead of archive folder.
3. **Add cache-busting meta tags** — `<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache...">` added to MIND index.html.
4. **Create protocol hierarchy** — STANDING_ORDERS.md (constitution) → PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY.md (cost rules) → DEV_PROCEDURE.md (dev specifics).
5. **Gateway watchdog with doctor** — Restart logic now runs `openclaw doctor` before restart attempts.

## Current State

- **MIND demo:** ✅ Working at https://iamhicks.com/mind-demo/ (7,355 lines, AI features, cache headers)
- **Backups:** ✅ All 5 components backing up to `/Documents/Kai/Backup/08-02-26/1048/`
- **Protocols:** ✅ STANDING_ORDERS.md and PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY.md created and synced
- **Watchdog:** ✅ Running (PID 49069), logs to `.openclaw/watchdog/watchdog.log`
- **Obsidian sync:** ✅ All files synced to `Kai/Kai Memory/`

## Next Steps

1. Update OpenClaw to latest version (user task)
2. Test MIND thoroughly — verify AI features, tag filtering, all functionality
3. Consider moving website to Vercel/Netlify to avoid cache issues
4. Apply Three-Strike and Scalpel rules in future sessions
5. Split FLOW into modular files (when ready)

## Lessons Learned

- **Trust git history, not archive folders** — Archive had old version, git had correct version with all fixes.
- **Three-Strike rule is real** — Tried MIND modular split 3+ times, all failed. Should have stopped and asked.
- **GitHub Pages caching is aggressive** — Need cache-busting on every deploy.
- **Verify file existence before acting** — Check with `ls`/`cat` before assuming.
- **Log immediately, not after** — If it's not written down, it doesn't exist.
