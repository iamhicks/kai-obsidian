## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE: The Fractal Hierarchy

**TTrades Model Timeframe Alignment:**

```
DAILY (Bias/Filter)
    ↓
4H (Setup - C2/C3 identification)
    ↓
1H/30M (Confirmation - CISD)
    ↓
5M/3M (Entry execution)
```

**Key Rule:** All timeframes must agree. Never trade against the Daily bias.

## 🕯️ CANDLE CLOSURES - THE FOUNDATION

### **Candle 2 (C2) - Early Signal**

**Characteristics:**
- Second candle after structure break
- Early entry opportunity
- **Lower probability** than C3
- Higher risk

**When to Trade C2:**
- Small wick (supports expansion)
- Strong reversal candle formation
- CISD confirmed on lower timeframe
- TTrades: "Don't trade C2 unless you're advanced"

**Wick Analysis:**
- **Small wick** = Supports expansion ✅
- **Large wick** = Rejection, wait for C3 ⚠️

> **Quote:** "We want to be trading expansion candles which have small wicks that support expansion."

---

### **Candle 3 (C3) - Confirmation (PREFERRED)**

**Characteristics:**
- Third candle after structure break
- **Higher probability** setup
- Confirmation of direction
- TTrades: "This is what I prefer to trade"

**Why C3 is Better:**
1. Validates or invalidates the setup
2. Shows true market intent
3. Less likely to be caught in retracement
4. Clearer structure

**Trading C3:**
- Look for **reversal candle on C2** (sets up C3 continuation)
- C3 continues the direction established
- Entry on open of C3 or after CISD confirmation

> **Quote:** "C3 validates or invalidates the setup. C2 can get you caught in retracement, consolidation, or reversal."

**Ideal C2 Setup for C3 Trade:**
- Nice reversal candle on C2
- Price opens, trades aggressively, then reverses
- Forms clear reversal structure
- C3 continues that reversal direction

> **Quote:** "Focus on those candle twos that have a nice reversal candle. Don't try to trade candle twos that expand a ton."

---

### **Candle 4 (C4) - Continuation/Exhaustion**

**Characteristics:**
- Fourth candle in sequence
- Can show continuation or exhaustion
- Used for advanced setups

---

## 🔍 CHANGE IN STATE OF DELIVERY (CISD)

**Definition:** Structure shift confirmation on lower timeframe

**Purpose:**
- Validates higher timeframe narrative
- Confirms entry timing
- Reduces false entries

**How It Works:**
1. Price breaks structure (previous high/low)
2. New swing point formed
3. Close above/below confirms shift

**Example (Bullish):**
- Price makes new low
- Then closes above series of down-close candles
- This is CISD confirmation ✅

> **Quote:** "We want to see a close over that series of down close candles. That means we can be looking for continuations."

**Protected Swing:**
- Swing point that holds (not broken)
- Used for stop loss placement
- Invalidation point

> **Quote:** "Marking out the new low. Where is our series of down close candles? Let's see if we can get a close over that."

---

## 🎯 ENTRY CRITERIA CHECKLIST

### **Before Entering:**

**1. Daily Bias**
- [ ] Clear bullish or bearish structure
- [ ] Not fighting the HTF

**2. 4H Setup**
- [ ] C2 or C3 identified
- [ ] Prefer C3 over C2
- [ ] Price at key level (OB, FVG, previous high/low)

**3. 1H/30M Confirmation**
- [ ] CISD occurred
- [ ] Structure broken in direction of trade
- [ ] Protected swing established

**4. 5M/3M Entry**
- [ ] Entry trigger clear
- [ ] Stop loss logical (below protected swing)
- [ ] Target gives minimum 1:2 R:R

**5. Confluence (Optional)**
- [ ] SMT divergence
- [ ] Fair Value Gap at entry
- [ ] Order Block supporting entry

---

## 📊 REVERSAL vs CONTINUATION

### **Trading Reversals:**
- Look for C2 reversal candle
- Large wick showing rejection
- C3 continues the reversal
- Higher risk, higher reward

### **Trading Continuations:**
- C2 shows consolidation/small pullback
- C3 continues established trend
- Easier to trade per TTrades
- "Continuations are easier to trade"

---

## 🎯 ORDER BLOCKS & FAIR VALUE GAPS

### **Order Blocks (OB):**
- Institutional order zones
- Previous resistance becomes support (and vice versa)
- High-probability entry levels

**Usage:**
- Mark OBs on 4H/Daily
- Wait for price to return to OB
- Enter on CISD confirmation

> **Quote:** "Price reaches into a fair value gap here. Let's see if we can get a continuation from this point of interest."

### **Fair Value Gaps (FVG):**
- Imbalances in price
- Price often returns to fill gap
- Can be used as entry or target

---

## 🛡️ PROTECTED SWINGS & STOP LOSS

### **Protected Swing:**
- Swing point that hasn't been broken
- Confirms trend continuation
- Used for stop placement

**How to Identify:**
- Price makes new high/low
- Closes in direction of move
- Not broken by subsequent candles

> **Quote:** "We want to see a new low made to form a new protected swing. Marking out the new low."

### **Stop Loss Placement:**
- Below protected low (for longs)
- Above protected high (for shorts)
- Gives trade room to breathe
- Logical invalidation point

---

## 📈 RISK:REWARD (R:R)

**Minimum Requirement:** 1:2 R:R

**How TTrades Calculates:**
1. Entry point identified
2. Stop below protected swing
3. Target at liquidity (ERL) or projection
4. Adjust until 1:2 achieved

> **Quote:** "I ideally want to get a 1:2. So then I'm just going to raise it until I have that 1:2."

**Example:**
- Entry: 4830
- Stop: 4810 (20 points risk)
- Target: 4870 (40 points reward)
- R:R = 1:2 ✅

---

## 🔄 MARKET PHASES (Phases of Price)

### **1. Consolidation**
- Price range-bound
- Indecision in market
- Buildup of orders

### **2. Expansion**
- Strong directional move
- Small wicks
- One-sided candles
- **This is what we want to trade**

### **3. Retracement**
- Pullback within trend
- Healthy correction
- Often forms C2

### **4. Reversal**
- Trend change
- Large reversal wicks
- C2 reversal candle

> **Quote:** "We want to be trading expansion candles which have small wicks that support expansion."

---

## ⚠️ WHAT TO AVOID

### **Don't Trade When:**

1. **C2 has large expansion**
   - Risk of retracement/consolidation
   - Wait for C3 confirmation

2. **No CISD confirmation**
   - Structure not broken
   - No validation

3. **Candle 2 takes out all liquidity**
   - "If C2 would have expanded all the way to this low, that's something I'm not ever really going to trade."

4. **Fighting Daily bias**
   - Always check HTF first
   - Filter trades through Daily

5. **Poor R:R**
   - Less than 1:2
   - Not worth the risk

---

## 💡 ADVANCED CONCEPTS

### **SMT (Smart Money Tool) Divergence:**
- Correlated assets diverging
- Adds confluence to setup
- Can confirm reversals

> **Quote:** "Paired with SMT here, you could look to trade this reversal."

### **Propulsion Block:**
- Order block formed during expansion
- Used for continuation entries
- Lower timeframe entry within higher timeframe move

### **Liquidity Targets:**
- External Range Liquidity (ERL) - preferred target
- Internal Range Liquidity (IRL) - partial profits
- Previous highs/lows
- Equal highs/lows

## 📋 COMPLETE TRADE EXAMPLE

**Setup: Bullish Continuation on Gold (from transcript)**

**Daily:**

## 🎯 KEY QUOTES TO REMEMBER

3. **On CISD:** "We want to see a close over that series of down close candles."

4. **On Continuations:** "Continuations are easier to trade."

5. **On Wick Size:** "We want to be trading expansion candles which have small wicks that support expansion."
