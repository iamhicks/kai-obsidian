### Launch Announcements

**1. Direct**
```
Launching MIND — a knowledge base that respects you.

✓ Works offline
✓ No subscription
✓ $29 one-time
✓ Your data stays yours

Stop renting your notes. Own them.

→ iamhicks.com/mind-demo
```

**2. Problem/Solution**
```
I was paying $144/year for Notion.

So I built MIND:
• Same clean design
• Works offline
• $29 once

Break-even: 3 months
Savings over 10 years: $1,411

Sometimes the best feature is the price.
```

**3. Privacy Angle**
```
Your notes app shouldn't know more about you than you do.

MIND:
❌ No account required
❌ No cloud sync (unless YOU want it)
❌ No tracking, ever

✓ Just you and your thoughts

$29. Yours forever.
```

**4. Provocative**
```
Hot take: Knowledge workers are getting scammed.

$10-15/month for tools that:
• Require internet
• Harvest your data
• Trap you in subscriptions

MIND is $29 once.
Same quality. Zero rent. Total privacy.

Stop paying rent on your own brain.
```

**5. Feature Tease**
```
Tag filtering in MIND:

Click "Work" → See all work notes
Click "Work" + "Urgent" → Only urgent work notes
Click "Personal" + "Ideas" → Personal ideas only

Your knowledge, organized YOUR way.

$29 one-time → iamhicks.com
```

### Value-Based Posts

**6. Philosophy**
```
The subscription economy wants you to forget you're paying.

$10/month feels small.
$120/year doesn't.
$1,200/decade is insane.

MIND: $29 once.

Own your tools.
Own your data.
Define yourself.
```

**7. Indie Hacker Angle**
```
As an indie hacker, I couldn't find tools that matched my values.

So I built them:
✓ One-time purchase
✓ Privacy-first
✓ Beautiful design
✓ Works offline

The i_am_Hicks suite:
- MIND (notes)
- FLOW (tasks)
- EDGE (trading)
- VAULT (finance)

$29 each or $99 all.
No subscriptions. Ever.
```

**8. Comparison**
```
Notion: $10/month, cloud-required, slow
Obsidian: Free but complex, $8/mo for sync
Apple Notes: Free but limited, ecosystem locked

MIND: $29 once, offline-native, just works

Sometimes the best tool is the one that gets out of your way.
```

**9. Social Proof Format**
```
"I calculated I was spending $2,400/year on productivity apps.

Switched to i_am_Hicks suite:
• MIND for notes
• FLOW for tasks
• EDGE for trading journal
• VAULT for finances

Total: $99 once
Annual savings: $2,301

Sometimes doing the math changes everything."
```

**10. Pain Point**
```
The worst feeling: Opening your notes app and waiting...

...for the cloud to sync
...for the spinner to stop  
...for YOUR thoughts to load

MIND works offline.
Instant. Always. Everywhere.

Because your ideas shouldn't have loading times.
```

### Product-Specific (MIND)

**11-15. MIND Deep Dives**

```
MIND feature spotlight: Tag filtering

Most notes apps: Folders OR tags
MIND: Folders AND tags AND search

Example structure:
📁 Work/
  📁 Clients/
    → Note tagged: "urgent" + "invoice" + "follow-up"

Filter by any combination. Find anything.
```

```
Why MIND doesn't have "AI features":

1. Your notes stay private (no API calls)
2. It works offline (no latency)
3. You think better when you organize manually
4. We don't need to justify a subscription

Sometimes "simple" is the feature.
```

```
Real talk: I built MIND for myself.

I wanted:
✓ Notion's cleanliness
✓ Obsidian's privacy
✓ Apple Notes' simplicity
✗ None of their price tags or cloud dependencies

$29. One time.
Use it for 10 years: $0.24/month

iamhicks.com/mind-demo
```

```
The MIND demo resets every hour.

Why? So you can play without commitment.
But when you buy — it's yours forever.

Try → Love → Own

That's the i_am_Hicks way.
```

```
"But does it sync between devices?"

MIND stores files locally. You can:
• Use Dropbox/iCloud/any sync
• Export to Markdown
• Version control with Git
• Just use one device

You choose. We don't force cloud on you.
```

### Engagement Posts

**16-20. Questions & Polls**

```
Poll: How much do you spend monthly on productivity apps?

□ $0 (respect)
□ $1-10
□ $10-25
□ $25-50
□ $50+ (yikes)

I was in the $50+ camp before building my own.
Never again.
```

```
Unpopular opinion:

The best notes app is the one that opens instantly.

Not the one with:
• 500 plugins
• Database views
• Collaborative features you never use

Just fast. Reliable. Yours.

Agree or disagree?
```

```
Hot take:

Markdown is great for developers.
It's terrible for normal humans.

That's why MIND has a proper WYSIWYG editor.
Your mom could use it.
Your client won't see code.

Good design is inclusive.
```

```
I asked 100 people why they don't use privacy-focused tools.

Top answer: "They're ugly"

So we built i_am_Hicks apps to look like this 👇
[screenshot]

Privacy doesn't have to look like 1995.
```

```
What's your biggest frustration with your current notes app?

1. Too expensive
2. Too slow
3. Privacy concerns
4. Too complex
5. Requires internet

We're solving all of the above with MIND.
```

### Suite/Bundling

**21-25. Bundle Posts**

```
The i_am_Hicks bundle:

🧠 MIND — Notes & knowledge
⚡ FLOW — Tasks & focus
📈 EDGE — Trading journal
💰 VAULT — Finance tracking

Separately: $116
Bundle: $99 (save $17)

Complete productivity. One purchase. Forever.
```

```
Idea: Your operating system for life.

MIND → Knowledge
FLOW → Execution
EDGE → Growth (trading/business)
VAULT → Wealth

All offline. All private. All yours.

$99 for the suite.
Less than most people pay for Netflix in a year.
```

```
Buy the bundle, save $17, thank yourself later.

iamhicks.com
```

```
The subscription stack:
Notion $10
Todoist $4
Trading journal $15
Finance app $8
= $444/year

The i_am_Hicks stack:
All 4 apps = $99 once

You do the math.
```

```
If you buy just one app and love it, you'll want the others.

If you buy the bundle now, you save $17 and get everything.

Both are good decisions.
The bundle is the smarter one.
```

### Urgency/Scarcity

**26-30. Launch/Deal Posts**

```
Launch week special:
MIND for $19 (normally $29)

✓ All features included
✓ Lifetime updates
✓ 30-day guarantee

Price goes up Sunday at midnight.

→ iamhicks.com
```

```
First 100 buyers get:
• MIND for $19
• My personal productivity templates
• Private Discord access

82/100 spots taken.

Don't sleep on this.
```

```
Last call: MIND launch pricing ends tonight.

$19 → $29 at midnight PST.

Own your knowledge for less than a dinner out.
```

```
The demo resets every hour.
But the launch discount? That resets never.

$19 for MIND ends tonight.
→ iamhicks.com
```

```
I've built apps for 6 months.
You can try the demo for 1 hour.
Or own it for $19 (today only).

Seems fair.
```

### Educational/Authority

**31-35. Tips & Insights**

```
Why local-first software is the future:

1. Speed — no network latency
2. Privacy — no data harvesting
3. Reliability — works offline
4. Longevity — no vendor lock-in
5. Cost — one-time vs subscription

The web made us forget how fast apps can be.
```

```
Building offline-first apps is harder.

You can't rely on:
• Cloud databases
• Real-time sync
• Server-side rendering

Everything must work locally. Instantly.

But the result? 
Software that's actually fast.
```

```
The best productivity system:

MIND → Capture ideas
FLOW → Turn ideas into tasks
EDGE → Track progress (trading/biz metrics)
VAULT → Monitor financial impact

Knowledge → Action → Results → Wealth

That's the i_am_Hicks loop.
```

```
If your productivity app requires:
• 10 hours of setup
• 50 YouTube tutorials
• A "second brain" methodology
• Weekly maintenance

It's a hobby, not a tool.

Good tools work immediately.
```

```
SaaS companies hate this one trick:

Build software that works forever without calling home.

No:
• Subscription revenue
• Data to sell
• Lock-in to exploit

Just honest work, fair price, happy customers.

Radical, I know.
```

### Behind the Scenes

**36-40. Personal/Story**

```
Why I built i_am_Hicks:

I was paying $200/month for software.
I didn't own any of it.
My data was scattered across 12 platforms.

So I spent 6 months building what I actually wanted.

Now I pay $0/month.
Own everything.
Sleep better.

You can too.
```

```
Day 1 of building MIND: "This will take 2 weeks"
Day 180: "Finally ready"

Software is hard.
Doing it right is harder.
But shipping something you're proud of?
Worth every minute.

iamhicks.com/mind-demo
```

```
The i_am_Hicks logo took 47 iterations.

The name came from wanting something personal:
i_am → define yourself
Hicks → an everyman name

This isn't corporate software.
It's built by a human, for humans.
```

```
My mom tried MIND yesterday.

"This is pretty. I can actually use this."

That's when I knew we nailed it.

Notion-quality design.
Grandma-usable interface.
Indie-dev soul.

iamhicks.com
```

```
Fun fact: The auto-reset demo started as a bug.

Then I realized: People can try forever without commitment.
It's actually a feature.

Sometimes constraints create better experiences.

## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second
"i_am_Hicks makes beautiful productivity tools you buy once and own forever. No subscriptions, no cloud required, no BS."

### 30-Second
"Most productivity software is subscription-based, tracks your data, and stops working without internet. We built the alternative: MIND for notes, FLOW for tasks, EDGE for trading, VAULT for finance. $29 each, one time. They work offline. Your data stays local. And they actually look good."

### 60-Second
"I was paying $200/month for productivity software and didn't own any of it. So I spent 6 months building i_am_Hicks — four apps that cover everything: notes, tasks, trading journal, and finance tracking. Each is $29 once, not $10/month forever. They work completely offline. Your data never leaves your machine unless you want it to. And they look like Notion but feel faster because there's no cloud latency. It's for people who are tired of renting their tools and want to own their productivity stack. $29 each or $99 for all four. Forever yours."

MIND: $29 once, works offline, exports to Markdown.
