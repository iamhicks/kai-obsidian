# Session Summary - 07-02-2026 (Evening)

## Work Completed

### i_am_Hicks Website Redesign
Major design overhaul completed for the product suite website:

1. **Monochrome Color Scheme**
   - Off-white: #F1F1F1
   - Dark: #1B1B1D
   - Text: #FFFFFF, #817D7D on dark; #000000 on light
   - Flat buttons, no gradients or shadows

2. **Typography**
   - Switched to Fraunces serif font (matching superrb.com style)
   - Clean Inter for body text

3. **Layout Updates**
   - Removed hero badge and text animations
   - Fixed hero visibility (i_am_ now clearly visible)
   - Tightened spacing on product cards
   - Static wave dividers (removed animation causing white gaps)
   - Removed product icons from cards

4. **Content Changes**
   - Rebranded: MIND → Mind_ai, FLOW → Flow_ai
   - Changed tagline: "Flow - i am Focus" → "Flow - i am Focused"
   - Added AI messaging throughout
   - Updated product mockups to highlight AI features
   - Removed Pete section from About page
   - Removed phrases: "used by millions", "Faceless corporation", "Built by a real human"
   - Moved "Mind_ai vs The Rest" comparison to Mind page
   - Added Markdown import/paste feature description

5. **Navigation**
   - Top: Mind_ai | Flow_ai | About Us
   - Footer: Home | Mind_ai | Flow_ai | About Us
   - Consistent across all pages

6. **Pages Updated**
   - Main index.html
   - /mind/index.html (monochrome + comparison section)
   - /flow/index.html (monochrome styling)
   - /about/index.html (monochrome, removed founder section)

## Technical Decisions
- Static SVG waves instead of animated (fixes rendering issues)
- Flat monochrome buttons (no gradients, no shadows)
- CSS-based product mockups (no external images)

## Next Steps (Deferred)
- Monitor for any remaining styling issues
- Consider adding more AI feature details to product pages
- Potential: Custom illustrations when budget allows

## Key Lesson
User prefers clean, minimal, monochrome aesthetic. Avoid animations that can break or distract. Flat design over gradients/shadows.
