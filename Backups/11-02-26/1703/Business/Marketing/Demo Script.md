# Demo Script

## Video Walkthrough Script (5-7 minutes)

### Hook (0:00-0:30)

**[Screen: Fast cuts of trader frustration]**

**Voiceover:**
"I've tried 6 different trading journals. All of them had the same problems — expensive subscriptions, cloud-only storage, bloated features, and zero psychology tracking. So I built my own."

**[Transition to app screen]**

"This is Trading Journal Pro — Fractal Model Edition."

---

### Problem/Solution (0:30-1:00)

**[Screen: Side-by-side comparison]**

**Voiceover:**
"Most journals cost $25-50 per month. Forever. They store your data on their servers. They're slow. And they ignore the #1 factor in your trading results — your psychology."

**[Switch to the app]**

"This runs entirely on your machine. $24 one-time. And it tracks what actually matters."

---

### Feature Walkthrough 1: Trade Logging (1:00-2:30)

**[Screen: Adding a new trade]**

**Voiceover:**
"Let me show you how fast this is. I click 'Add Trade' — and my template auto-fills."

**[Type quickly]**
- Pair: EUR/USD
- Setup: C3 Long
- Entry: 1.0850
- Stop: 1.0830
- Target: 1.0890

"I can add notes, attach a screenshot, and I'm done. Under 10 seconds."

**[Screen: Trade saved, stats update]**

"My statistics update automatically. Win rate, expectancy, R-multiples — all calculated instantly."

---

### Feature Walkthrough 2: Psychology Tracking (2:30-4:00)

**[Screen: Pre-trade checklist]**

**Voiceover:**
"Now here's where it gets interesting. Before I take a trade, I fill out the psychology checklist."

**[Fill out fields]**
- Mood: 7/10
- Confidence: 6/10
- Sleep: 6 hours
- Stress: 4/10

"This takes 5 seconds, but it's game-changing."

**[Screen: Post-trade reflection]**

"After the trade, I log my discipline. Did I follow my plan? What emotions came up?"

**[Show emotion tags: FOMO, Fear, Greed, etc.]**

"Over time, the app shows me patterns. Like... I lose 40% more when I sleep less than 6 hours. Or my win rate drops when my confidence is too high — overconfidence."

**[Screen: Psychology correlation charts]**

"This is the insight that changes your trading."

---

### Feature Walkthrough 3: Templates & Customization (4:00-5:00)

**[Screen: Template manager]**

**Voiceover:**
"The app comes with pre-loaded templates for the Fractal Model — C2/C3 setups, CISD tracking, Protected Swings. But you can customize everything."

**[Show editing a template]**

"Add your own trade types. Custom checklist items. Make it match your exact model."

---

### Pricing & CTA (5:00-6:00)

**[Screen: Pricing page]**

**Voiceover:**
"Here's the best part. No subscriptions. $24 one-time. You own it forever. Free updates. 30-day money-back guarantee."

**[Screen: Discord community]**

"Plus you get access to our private Discord — trading discussions, feature requests, direct support."

**[Back to app]**

"If you're serious about improving your trading — not just tracking P&L, but understanding WHY you win and lose — this is built for you."

**[Final CTA screen]**

"Link in description. Thanks for watching."
