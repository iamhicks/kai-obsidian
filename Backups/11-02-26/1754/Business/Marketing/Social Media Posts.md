### Thread 1: The Problem

**Tweet 1/5:**  
I've tried 6 different trading journals.

All of them had the same problems:
- $25-50/month subscriptions
- Cloud-only (your data on their servers)
- Bloated with features I'll never use
- Zero psychology tracking

So I built my own.

### Thread 2: The Psychology Angle

**Tweet 1/4:**  
Your strategy isn't why you're losing.

Your psychology is.

I built a trading journal that tracks the real reasons you lose money:
- Trading tired
- FOMO entries
- Revenge trading
- Ignoring your rules

**Tweet 2/4:**  
Most journals track P&L.

Mine tracks:
• Pre-trade mood (1-10)
• Confidence level
• Sleep quality
• Stress level
• Post-trade discipline score

Then shows you correlations.

**Tweet 3/4:**  
Real insight from beta tester:

"I discovered I have a 28% win rate when my confidence is above 8/10, but 62% when it's 6-7/10.

Overconfidence was killing me."

**Tweet 4/4:**  
Trading Journal Pro — Fractal Model Edition

Built for traders who want to master their psychology, not just track P&L.

$24 one-time. Link in bio.

Hey r/Daytrading,

After trying 6 different trading journals and hating all of them, I built my own.

**The problems with existing journals:**
- $25-50/month subscriptions (forever)
- Cloud-only (privacy concerns)
- Bloated with useless features
- Zero psychology tracking

**What I built:**

Trading Journal Pro — Fractal Model Edition

It's a local-first, privacy-focused journal built specifically for traders following:
- TTrades Fractal Model
- GxT Universal Model
- ICT / Smart Money Concepts

**Key features:**
• Pre-loaded C2/C3, CISD templates
• Psychology tracking (mood, discipline, emotions)
• Runs entirely offline on your machine
• $24 one-time (no subscriptions)

**The psychology module is the game-changer.** It tracks your pre-trade mood, confidence, sleep, stress — then shows you correlations like "I lose 40% more when I sleep less than 6 hours."

Mood. Discipline. Emotions. Correlations.
