# Session: 11-02-2026 - MIND App Sorting Fixes

## Accomplishments
- Fixed **Pinned (Favorites) sort dropdown** — was invisible, now shows correctly
- Fixed **folder date sorting** — added `createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps to new folders
- Added **"Custom (Manual Order)"** option to Folders section for drag-and-drop reordering
- Fixed **dropdown text wrapping** — added `white-space: nowrap` and wider dropdown
- Added **"Inspect Element"** to right-click context menu for DevTools access
- Fixed sort to actually persist the new order (calls `saveData()`)
- Made date sorting consistent across Folders and Pinned sections

## Blockers
- None — all sorting features now working

## Next Step
- User testing the updated sort functionality
- Consider adding drag-and-drop indicators for manual reordering

## Reflection
- **Worked:** Systematic debugging — checking if code exists, then checking if it runs, then checking behavior
- **Didn't:** Initially missed that folders had no timestamps (old data structure)

## Files Changed
- `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/app/index.html`
- `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/main.js` (Inspect Element menu)

## Backups
- `11-02-26/1828/` — Dropdown width fix
- `11-02-26/1841/` — Full sort fix with timestamps + Custom option
