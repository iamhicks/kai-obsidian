## Accomplishments

### MIND App Fixes (Completed)
1. **Save as Note saves content** — Fixed `saveAiChatAsNote()` to create note with content already set (was creating empty note first)
2. **Sort modal position** — Changed dropdown to appear below sort icon instead of floating above
3. **Note sorting within folders** — Added per-folder sort button (↕️) next to "+" button with options:
   - Alphabetical (A-Z)
   - Date Created
   - Date Modified
   - Each folder has independent sort preference stored in `settings.noteSort[folderId]`
4. **AI typing animation** — Changed from 3 bouncing dots to spinning robot (ph-robot) icon

### Architecture Decisions
- Note sort preferences stored per-folder for flexibility
- Sort dropdown uses same styling as other folder dropdowns for consistency
- Auto-expand folders when notes added (already working, verified)

## Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
1. Test all fixes after app restart
2. Consider AI chat memory (conversation history) — requires storing previous messages

## Lessons
- When creating notes programmatically, set content at creation time, not after
- Dropdown positioning: `top: 100%; margin-top: 4px;` places below element
- Per-folder settings pattern: `settings[feature][folderId]` enables granular control

## Context
- MIND app location: `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/app/`
- Main files: `index.html` (app), `main.js`, `preload.js`, `package.json`
- Stable backup exists at `Backups/11-02-26/`
