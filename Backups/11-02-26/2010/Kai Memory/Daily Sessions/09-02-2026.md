# Session Summary - 09-02-2026

**Date:** 09-02-2026  
**Duration:** 6+ hours (14:52 - 21:00+)  
**Focus:** OpenClaw framework implementation — Heartbeat, Eyes, DNA, Muscles, Bones  
**Outcome:** Success — All 5 prompts implemented

---

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Completed

**Core Principles Established**
- Added NON-NEGOTIABLE principles to MEMORY.md:
  - Offline-first — works without internet, no data leaving the machine
  - One-time purchase — $29 and done, no subscription fatigue
  - Local AI — privacy, no API costs, no rate limits
  - Simplicity — does one thing well
- Reference these for all product/feature decisions to avoid SaaS creep

**Heartbeat (Evolution System)** — `HEARTBEAT.md` updated
- Daily rhythm: Session summaries, bullets, 5-10 lines max
- Weekly review: Sunday evenings
- Memory curation: Promote lessons to MEMORY.md, archive daily logs >7 days
- File size limits: MEMORY.md (65K), SOUL.md (10K), AGENTS.md (30K)
- Session auto-clear after 30 days, run `/compact` at 80% context
- Templates created: `memory/TEMPLATE.md`, `memory/weekly-reviews/TEMPLATE.md`

**Eyes (Activation System)** — Monitoring implemented
- GitHub activity check every 2 hours (was incorrectly set to 2 minutes — fixed!)
- Backup verification daily at 07:00
- Quiet hours: 23:00-07:00 (alerts only for urgent issues)
- Telegram for all alerts
- Immediate alerts: Backup failures, gateway crashes
- Batched summaries: GitHub activity at 07:00

**DNA (Behavioral Logic)** — `AGENTS.md` expanded with:
- Decision protocols: Reversible vs irreversible actions
- Risk tolerance: Cost thresholds ($10), data sensitivity, external visibility
- Security posture: Self-modification limits (can edit SOUL/MEMORY/HEARTBEAT, NOT gateway config)
- Escalation paths: Immediate/batched/silent
- Uncertainty handling: Confidence thresholds (80%, 50-80%, <50%)
- Communication rules: Milestones not steps, surface blockers immediately
- Autonomy levels table: Full (files/git/backups) → None (external posts)

**Muscles (AI Model Inventory)** — `TOOLS.md` expanded:
- Primary model: Kimi K2.5 ($40/month plan)
- NO Ollama-OpenClaw integration — learned from Feb 2025 crash that corrupted config
- Cost routing: All tasks → Kimi K2.5 (simple, no switching)
- Budget guardrails: $50 hard limit, 80% alert threshold ($40)
- Cost monitoring: Daily tracking, manual override only

**Bones (Codebase Documentation)** — Created skills/:
- `skills/mind/SKILL.md` — Full MIND architecture (7,355 lines, single file, Tauri desktop)
- `skills/website/SKILL.md` — Website structure, GitHub Pages, monochrome design
- `skills/codebases/SKILL.md` — Repo map, cross-repo patterns, development workflow
- All synced to Obsidian

**Repo Restructure**
- Moved to organized folder structure:
  - `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/website/` — Marketing site only
  - `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/demo/` — Web demo (from website/mind-demo/)
  - `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/mind/app/` — Tauri desktop (from website/mind-tauri/)
  - `~/Documents/Kai/Repos/flow/demo/` — Empty (for future)
- Updated `backup-all.sh` to reflect new structure
- `memory/pending-tasks.md` created with cleanup reminders (deprecated folders to remove Feb 13)

**Mobile Decision**
- Skip mobile app/PWA for now
- Desktop-first product (Tauri .dmg/.exe)
- Mobile web demo exists but is "companion view only"
- No cloud features (avoids competing with Notion/Obsidian)

**Bug Fixes**
- GitHub monitor cron: Fixed from every 2 minutes → every 2 hours (was flooding Telegram)
- Standing Orders: Added ORDER 11 (mid-session checkpoints every 30 minutes) to prevent memory loss

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered
- **Session memory loss risk** — No mid-session checkpoints before today. Fixed with ORDER 11.
- **GitHub repo name confusion** — Cron monitoring looked for "i_am_Hicks/mind-demo" which doesn't exist. Real repos are under "hellokaibot-alt". Left for future fix.
- **Clock change artifacts** — Some backups dated "10-02-26" due to system clock change earlier today. Explained to user, not a real issue.

### 🚫 Blocked/Deferred
- **Cleanup deprecated folders** — `website/mind-demo/`, `website/mind-tauri/`, `website/flow-demo/` to be removed Feb 13 per `memory/pending-tasks.md`
- **GitHub repo monitoring fix** — Update cron to check correct repos (website, iamhicks-website, not imaginary ones)

## Technical Decisions

1. **No Ollama-OpenClaw integration** — Previous attempt (Gemma) corrupted config files in Feb 2025. Ollama stays external (MIND app only).

2. **Single-model routing** — All tasks → Kimi K2.5. No complex model switching that risks instability.

3. **Desktop-first, mobile-companion** — Full features (AI, backups) require desktop app. Mobile web is view-only.

4. **Mid-session checkpoints** — Added STANDING_ORDERS.md ORDER 11: Write checkpoint + commit every 30 minutes during active sessions.

5. **Skills documentation** — Per-repo SKILL.md files for MIND, website, codebases index.

## Current State

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| HEARTBEAT.md | ✅ Active | Workspace root |
| AGENTS.md | ✅ Updated | DNA protocols added |
| TOOLS.md | ✅ Updated | AI inventory, cost routing |
| Skills/ | ✅ Complete | mind/, website/, codebases/ |
| Repo structure | ✅ Organized | mind/demo/, mind/app/, flow/demo/ |
| GitHub monitor | ✅ Fixed | Every 2 hours (was 2 min) |
| Backups | ✅ Working | ~/Documents/Kai/Backup/OpenClaw/09-02-26/ |
| Weekly review | ⏳ Scheduled | First: This Sunday evening |

**Last backup:** 09-02-26/2142 (just completed)

## Next Steps

1. **Sunday evening** — First weekly review (HEARTBEAT.md ritual)
2. **Feb 13** — Cleanup deprecated folders from website/ (per pending-tasks.md)
3. **Future** — Fix GitHub monitor to check correct repos
4. **Future** — Build MIND Tauri desktop app when ready

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Write checkpoints during long sessions** — 6+ hours of work with no mid-session save = risk of total loss. ORDER 11 now requires 30-min checkpoints.
- **No Ollama in OpenClaw config** — Learned the hard way before, now codified in TOOLS.md.
- **Simple routing beats complex** — One model (Kimi K2.5), no switching logic, no breakage.
- **Mobile is a trap** — Cloud features = SaaS competition = bad. Stay desktop-first.
