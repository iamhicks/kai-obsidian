# Trading Journal App - Product Strategy Notes

## Target Market Decision
**Start with Fractal Model community** ✅

Why:
- Defined niche (TTrades + GxTradez followers = 100K+ traders)
- Already organized (Discord, X communities)
- They're SEEKING structure (your ideal customers)
- Easier to market to specific group than "all traders"
- Can expand to broader market once established

## Customizable Models/Checklists
**Build model-agnostic from the start** ✅

Implementation:
- Default template = Fractal Model (C2/C3, CISD, Protected Swings)
- User can edit/add their own checklist items
- Multiple "trade types" they can customize
- Import/export templates (community sharing)

This becomes a FEATURE not a limitation.

## Installation Requirements
Depends on tech stack:

**Option A: Web App (HTML/CSS/JS)**
- User needs: Just a web browser
- Run locally: Open index.html
- Pros: Universal, no install
- Cons: Looks less "professional"

**Option B: Python + Tkinter/PyQt**
- User needs: Python installed (or bundled exe)
- Run: Double-click executable
- Pros: Native feel, more features
- Cons: Platform-specific builds (Windows/Mac/Linux)

**Option C: Electron App**
- User needs: Nothing (packaged executable)
- Run: Install like normal app
- Pros: Web tech, native feel, cross-platform
- Cons: Larger file size

**Recommendation: Option C (Electron) or A (simple web)**

## Backup Solution
Easy options:
1. **Auto-export to JSON** - User picks folder, daily auto-save
2. **Cloud sync option** - Connect their own Dropbox/Google Drive
3. **Manual export** - One-click backup file

Keep it simple: Auto-save to user-selected folder, they handle cloud if they want.

## Piracy Protection
**Reality check: You can't stop it.**

Options:
1. **License keys** - Gumroad handles this, casual deterrent
2. **Accept it** - $25 is low enough that honest people buy
3. **Watermark** - Unique identifier per copy (technical overhead)

**Recommendation:**
- Use Gumroad's basic license system
- Accept 10-20% piracy as marketing cost
- Focus on:
  - Updates (paid customers get new versions)
  - Community (Discord support for buyers)
  - Reputation (become THE fractal model journal)

Pirates weren't going to pay anyway. Focus on the honest majority.

## Action Items
1. ✅ Market research done
2. 🔄 Build v2 features (psychology module, custom checklists)
3. ⏳ Decide: Web app vs Electron
4. ⏳ Create demo data
5. ⏳ Build landing page
