## Problem Section

### Headline
Most Trading Journals Are Broken

**They're either:**
- ❌ Expensive subscriptions ($25-50/month forever)
- ❌ Cloud-based (your data on someone else's server)
- ❌ Overly complex (features you'll never use)
- ❌ Missing psychology (the #1 factor in your results)
- ❌ Slow and clunky (logging trades feels like a chore)

**The result?** You stop using them. And you stop learning from your mistakes.
