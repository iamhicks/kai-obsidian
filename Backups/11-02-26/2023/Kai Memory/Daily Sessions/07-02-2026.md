  - `Archive/` — old files (empty)
- Updated AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md with new protocols

- Removed duplicate files from root
- Synced everything to Obsidian

### ✅ Session Protocol Established

- Write to `Daily Sessions/DD-MM-YYYY.md`
- Update MEMORY.md with curated points
- Sync to Obsidian automatically

## Technical Decisions

1. **Memory date format:** DD-MM-YYYY to match Pete's preference
2. **Folder structure:** Daily Sessions / Reference / Archive
3. **Defer Mission Control:** Build after i_am_Hicks products launched

---

## Future Projects (Deferred)

### Mission Control Dashboard
**Source:** Alex Finn's recommendation via X/Twitter  
**Status:** Deferred — revisit after MIND/EDGE/FLOW/VAULT complete  

**Components:**
1. **Activity feed** — tracks everything OpenClaw does
2. **Calendar view** — visual weekly view of scheduled tasks
3. **Global search** — unified search across all memories, tasks, documents

**Tech stack suggested:** NextJS + Convex + Codex  
**Effort estimate:** 22-32 hours (3-4 days)  
**Alternative:** Quick file-based versions (1-2 hours) as interim solution

**Decision:** Hold for now, revisit after product suite complete

---

## Current State
- Memory system: Fully organized and operational
- MIND demo: Ready for testing (from previous session)
- Next priority: Test MIND tag results, then continue with EDGE/FLOW/VAULT

---

## Next Steps
1. Test MIND demo tag results (clear cache first)
2. Fix any remaining issues with tag results
3. Continue with EDGE, FLOW, VAULT demos
4. **Revisit Mission Control** after product suite launched

---

## Notes
- Pete wants to come back to Mission Control later — logged in MEMORY.md
- Memory system now self-documenting via README.md
- All synced to Obsidian with proper structure

*Session ended. Mission Control deferred for later.*

## Evening Session - Website & Marketing Updates

### Critical Discovery: Website Repo Confusion
**Problem:** Multiple repos (website, iamhicks-website) - was pushing to wrong one
**Solution:** Live site is served from `hellokaibot-alt/website` (KnowledgeBase folder), NOT `iamhicks-website`
**Action:** Successfully pushed updates to correct repo

### Website Updates Completed
- Homepage updated to focus on MIND + FLOW only
- EDGE and VAULT removed from main navigation
- MIND product page created with features, FAQ, user guide
- FLOW product page created with features, FAQ, user guide
- About Us page created with founder story, values, mission
- Bundle pricing: MIND + FLOW for $49 (save $9)
- All content uses elevator pitch from Copy Bank

### Marketing Materials Created
- Brand Identity & Values document
- Ideal Customer Persona document
- MIND Product Marketing document
- Copy Bank with 40 X/Twitter post templates
- Revenue Strategy & Marketing Plan (financial projections)
- Cold Start Marketing Plan (starting from zero audience)
- Launch Tactics & Sales Ideas (15 additional tactics)
- Reddit & Product Hunt Launch Kit (safe posting strategies)

### Key Lessons
1. Always verify CNAME file location - determines which repo serves the live site
2. GitHub Pages can take 10-30 minutes to propagate globally
3. Reddit requires karma building before promotional posts (3-5 days minimum)
4. Multiple marketing channels needed since X was temporarily blocked

### Next Steps
- Monitor website deployment (check in 10 minutes)
- Prepare Product Hunt launch materials (gallery images)
- Build Reddit karma before posting
- Consider launching on Product Hunt + Reddit + HN simultaneously

## Late Evening Session - Design Feedback

### User Feedback on Website
**Issue:** New dark-themed design not as good as original Apple-style design
**Specific feedback:**
- Hero should keep "i_am_Hicks" with "Define yourself" strapline
- "Built Different" section from old site was better
- Revert to original clean white/light theme with glassmorphism

### Old Site Elements to Keep:
- Apple-style design (white, clean, professional)
- Glassmorphism effects
- Typography style
- "Built Different" section with 6 pillars (Private, Free, Fast, Portable, Focused, Professional)
- Stats row: 0 Subscriptions | 4 Powerful Apps | 100% Private | ∞ Possibilities

### Hero Text Options Discussed:
1. Original: "Your data. Your device. Your control. Professional tools without the surveillance."
2. Alternative: "Define yourself" + "Beautiful, offline-first productivity tools you actually own"
3. Alternative: "Define yourself" + "Stop renting your productivity. Own it forever."
4. Alternative: "Define yourself" + "MIND for knowledge. FLOW for focus. $49 bundle."

### Key Lessons
- Original design was more polished - don't reinvent what worked
- User prefers Apple-style aesthetic over dark theme
- Keep successful elements (Built Different, stats, structure)
- Only update content (MIND + FLOW focus), not the design language

### Next Steps
- Revert website to original Apple-style design
- Update content only (remove EDGE/VAULT, keep MIND + FLOW)
- Keep "Built Different" section exactly as before
- Choose hero text with user
