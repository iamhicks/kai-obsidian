## 🎯 ORIGINAL CONVERSATION

This system was established on 2026-02-03 when Pete asked:

> "Based on what you know about me and my goals, what are some tasks you can do to get us closer to our missions? What other information can I provide you to improve our productivity. can you do one thing each nite that will get us closer to our goals, suprise me each morning with what you have built"

**Kai's response:** Created this autonomous nightly mission system.
