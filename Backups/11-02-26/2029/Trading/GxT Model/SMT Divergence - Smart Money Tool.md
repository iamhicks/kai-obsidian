## 🎯 What is SMT?

**SMT = Smart Money Tool** (also called SMT Divergence)

A divergence between correlated assets that reveals where "smart money" is truly positioned. When two correlated assets move differently, it signals which one is leading and which is following.

**Core Principle:** Correlated assets should move together. When they don't, pay attention.

## 🔄 How SMT Works

### **Basic Concept:**

**Correlated Assets (Example):**
- US100 (NQ/NDX) - Nasdaq
- US500 (ES/SPX) - S&P 500
- US30 (YM/Dow) - Dow Jones

**Normal Behavior:**
- All three move in same direction
- If Nasdaq goes up, S&P and Dow usually follow

**SMT Divergence:**
- Nasdaq makes NEW HIGH
- S&P 500 FAILS to make new high
- **This is SMT Divergence** ⚠️

### **What It Means:**
- Nasdaq showing weakness (false strength)
- S&P showing true weakness
- **S&P is leading** (showing true direction)
- **Nasdaq will likely follow S&P down**

---

## 📊 Types of SMT Divergence

### **1. Bearish SMT (Hidden Bearish)**

**Setup:**
- Asset A: Makes higher high
- Asset B: Fails to make higher high (lower high)

**Interpretation:**
- Asset A showing false strength
- Asset B showing true weakness
- **Trade direction:** Short (follow Asset B)

**Example:**
- NQ (US100): New high at 19500
- ES (US500): Lower high at 5950 (previous 5960)
- **SMT Bearish** → Short NQ (it will follow ES down)

### **2. Bullish SMT (Hidden Bullish)**

**Setup:**
- Asset A: Makes lower low
- Asset B: Fails to make lower low (higher low)

**Interpretation:**
- Asset A showing false weakness
- Asset B showing true strength
- **Trade direction:** Long (follow Asset B)

**Example:**
- NQ (US100): New low at 19200
- ES (US500): Higher low at 5900 (previous 5890)
- **SMT Bullish** → Long NQ (it will follow ES up)

## 🔍 How to Identify SMT

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

**1. Choose Correlated Pairs**
- Primary: US100, US500, US30
- Secondary: XAUUSD (Gold) vs XAGUSD (Silver)

**2. Mark Swing Points**
- Look for recent highs/lows
- Mark on both assets
- Compare the swings

**3. Look for Divergence**
- One asset makes new extreme
- Other asset fails to make new extreme
- Note the discrepancy

**4. Determine Leader**
- Asset showing true price action = LEADER
- Asset showing false move = FOLLOWER

**5. Trade the Follower**
- Follower will eventually align with leader
- Enter in direction leader is showing

## 📈 SMT Trade Example (GxT Style)

### **Setup: Bearish SMT on US100**

**4H Chart:**
- **NQ (US100):** Makes new high at 19500
- **ES (US500):** Makes lower high at 5950 (vs previous 5960)
- **SMT Divergence detected** ⚠️

**Analysis:**
- ES showing true weakness (lower high)
- NQ showing false strength (new high, but diverging)
- ES is the **leader**
- NQ is the **follower** (will drop to catch up)

**Trade Plan:**
- **Direction:** Short NQ (US100)
- **Reason:** SMT divergence + ES weakness
- **Entry:** Wait for NQ to confirm (C3 or CISD)
- **Stop:** Above NQ high (19550)
- **Target:** Where ES liquidity is (5900 area)

**Result:** NQ drops to align with ES weakness ✅

## 🎯 SMT in Pete's Model

### **How to Use SMT:**

**Primary Use:** Confluence factor (not standalone)

**Best Combinations:**
1. **4H C3 setup + SMT divergence** = High probability
2. **CISD confirmation + SMT** = Strong entry
3. **At key level (OB/FVG) + SMT** = Precision entry

**GxT Priority:**
> *"These 3 core concepts are 90% of the sauce: Framework, Phases of Price, Profiling. Everything else [including SMT] is refinement/filtering."*

**Pete's Application:**
- Check SMT on correlated indices
- If SMT aligns with 4H setup → Trade
- If SMT conflicts with setup → Wait or pass

## ✅ SMT Checklist

**Before Using SMT:**

- [ ] **Correlated assets selected** (US100/US500/US30)
- [ ] **Same timeframe** comparing apples to apples
- [ ] **Clear swing points** on both assets
- [ ] **Divergence visible** one makes extreme, other doesn't
- [ ] **Leader identified** showing true price
- [ ] **Follower identified** will align to leader
- [ ] **HTF setup aligned** SMT confirms your bias

---

## ⚠️ SMT Limitations

**Don't Trade SMT Alone:**
- Needs HTF setup context
- Needs entry timing (CISD)
- Can be temporary (short-term divergence)

**False Signals:**
- Low timeframe noise
- News event affecting one asset
- End of day/overnight gaps

**Best Practice:**
- Use on 4H+ timeframes
- Combine with other confluence
- Wait for confirmation (don't front-run)

## 🔗 SMT vs Other Confluence

| Confluence | Priority | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **4H C3** | CRITICAL | Primary setup |
| **CISD** | CRITICAL | Entry timing |
| **Daily Bias** | CRITICAL | Filter |
| **SMT** | HIGH | Confirmation |
| **2-Stage Crack** | HIGH | Entry refinement |
| **PSP** | MEDIUM | Stop placement |
| **Asset Sync** | MEDIUM | Multi-asset view |

**SMT adds edge but isn't required for every trade.**

## 🔄 SMT + 2-Stage Crack (Advanced)

**GxT Combination:**

1. **Stage 1:** Price breaks level on one asset
2. **SMT Check:** Correlated assets diverging?
3. **Stage 2:** Confirming break with SMT alignment
4. **Entry:** When follower aligns with leader

**Example:**
- NQ breaks support (Stage 1)
- ES already broken support (SMT leader)
- YM still holding (SMT divergence)
- **Trade:** Short YM when it breaks (Stage 2)

## 🎓 Key Quotes from GxT

> *"These 3 core concepts are 90% of the sauce that you are looking for. 1) Framework - IRL/ERL, 2) Phases Of Price Delivery, 3) Profiling (OHLC/OLHC). Everything else revolves around these concepts and are only used for refinement/filtering."*

> *"SMT is a filter for price. It tells you which asset is leading and which is following."*

> *"If NQ is making new highs but ES isn't, ES is showing you the truth. NQ is lying."*

## 🚀 Practice Exercise

**On Your Charts:**

1. **Open 3 panels:**
   - US100 (NQ)
   - US500 (ES)
   - US30 (YM)

2. **Mark recent highs/lows** on all three

3. **Look for divergences:**
   - One makes new extreme
   - Others fail to follow

4. **Note the leader:**
   - Which showed true price first?

5. **Track the follower:**
   - Did it eventually align?
   - How long did it take?

**Expected Result:** You'll see SMT divergences 2-3 times per week on 4H timeframe.

## 💡 Quick Reference

| Pattern | Leader | Follower | Trade |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| NQ new high, ES lower high | ES | NQ | Short NQ |
| NQ new low, ES higher low | ES | NQ | Long NQ |
| ES new high, NQ lower high | NQ | ES | Short ES |
| ES new low, NQ higher low | NQ | ES | Long ES |

**Remember:** Trade the follower in the direction the leader is showing.

*SMT is your truth detector. When assets disagree, the one showing weakness usually wins.*
