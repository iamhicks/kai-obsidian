# EMERGENCY CHECKPOINT — 09-02-2026

**Written:** 21:31 GMT  
**Reason:** Session crash risk — preserving full context so reconstruction never needs to repeat

---

## IF SESSION RESTARTS — READ THIS FIRST

Today (09-02-2026, 14:52-21:30) we implemented the OpenClaw initialization framework:

### What Was Built:

1. **Core Principles** (MEMORY.md) — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
   - Offline-first, one-time purchase ($29), local AI, simplicity
   - Reference before any product/feature decision

2. **Heartbeat** (HEARTBEAT.md) — Evolution system:
   - Daily summaries (bullets, 5-10 lines)
   - Weekly review: Sunday evenings
   - Memory curation: Promote to MEMORY.md, archive >7 days
   - File size limits: MEMORY.md (65K), SOUL.md (10K)

3. **Eyes** — Activation/monitoring:
   - GitHub check every 2 hours (fixed from 2 min bug)
   - Backup verification daily 07:00
   - Quiet hours: 23:00-07:00
   - Telegram alerts only

4. **DNA** (AGENTS.md) — Behavioral logic:
   - Decision protocols (reversible vs irreversible)
   - Risk tolerance ($10 threshold, data sensitivity)
   - Security posture (no gateway config edits)
   - Escalation paths, uncertainty handling, autonomy levels

5. **Muscles** (TOOLS.md) — AI inventory:
   - Kimi K2.5 only ($40/month)
   - NO Ollama-OpenClaw integration (corrupted config before)
   - $50 hard limit alert
   - Simple tracking only

6. **Bones** (skills/) — Codebase docs:
   - `skills/mind/SKILL.md` — MIND architecture
   - `skills/website/SKILL.md` — Website structure
   - `skills/codebases/SKILL.md` — Repo map

7. **Repo Restructure**:
   - `mind/demo/` — Web demo
   - `mind/app/` — Tauri desktop
   - `flow/demo/` — Empty (future)

8. **Standing Orders Update** — ORDER 11:
   - Mid-session checkpoints every 30 minutes
   - Write progress + commit during active sessions

### Mobile Decision:
- Skip mobile app/PWA
- Desktop-first (Tauri .dmg/.exe)
- Mobile web = companion view only
- No cloud features (avoids SaaS competition)

### Files Updated Today:
- HEARTBEAT.md
- AGENTS.md  
- TOOLS.md
- skills/mind/SKILL.md
- skills/website/SKILL.md
- skills/codebases/SKILL.md
- memory/09-02-2026.md (full session summary)
- memory/pending-tasks.md (cleanup reminders)
- STANDING_ORDERS.md (ORDER 11 added)
- MEMORY.md (Core Principles added)

### Backups Completed:
- GitHub: hellokaibot-alt/kai-memory
- Local: ~/Documents/Kai/Backup/OpenClaw/09-02-26/2124/
- Obsidian: Kai Memory/

## NEXT: OpenClaw Update Review

Pete was about to paste OpenClaw update list (new features/fixes) when crash risk was flagged. 

**Action:** Review update list, assess what matters for our setup.
