# Marketing Plan

## i_am_Hicks Revenue-First Launch Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Generate $100K in Year 1 revenue from the i_am_Hicks suite

**Strategy:** Multi-phase launch with heavy emphasis on pre-launch list building, Product Hunt dominance, and community-driven growth

**Target:** 2,000 customers at $50 average order value

**Timeline:** 90-day pre-launch → 30-day launch window → ongoing growth

---

## Revenue-Focused Strategies

### 1. Pricing Psychology & Tier Structure

#### The Decoy Effect Strategy

| Tier | Price | Perceived Value | Target Conversion |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Single App** | $49 | Good | 25% |
| **2-App Bundle** | $79 | Better | 15% |
| **Full Suite** | $99 | Best (Hero) | **55%** |
| **Early Bird** | $79 | Limited time | 5% (launch only) |

**Psychology:** The $99 bundle is positioned as "obvious choice" — only $20 more than 2 apps, but you get 4.

#### Anchor Pricing

- **Display competitor costs first:**
  - Notion Pro: $15/mo = $180/year
  - Todoist Pro: $5/mo = $60/year
  - Streaks: $5/mo = $60/year
  
- **Then reveal:** i_am_Hicks Suite: $99 **once**

- **Frame:** "Less than 4 months of Notion. Yours forever."

#### Charm Pricing

- Use $49 instead of $50 (feels like $40-range)
- Use $99 instead of $100 (breaks triple-digit barrier)
- Use $79 early bird (creates urgency vs $99)

#### The "No Subscription" Premium

**Message:** "Other apps charge $120/year. We charge $49 once. We're not cheaper — we're honest."

This reframes from "budget option" to "values-aligned choice."

Hey [Name],

Long-time fan of your [specific video/post] on [topic]. 

I've been building i_am_Hicks — a productivity suite with a twist: 
no subscriptions, fully offline, you own everything.

Built it because I was tired of renting my notes from Notion.

Would love to send you a free license. No obligation to post, 
but I think your audience would appreciate the philosophy.

### 5. Early Adopter Discounts

#### Discount Structure

| Stage | Discount | Code | Eligibility | Duration |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Founder** | 40% off | FOUNDER40 | First 100 waitlist | Until sold |
| **Early Bird** | 20% off | EARLY20 | Waitlist subscribers | First 7 days |

**Example:**

---

## Growth Hacks

### 1. Free Demo → Paid Conversion Funnel

#### Demo Strategy

**The Offer:**
- Fully functional app
- Resets every 7 days
- All features included
- No credit card required

**The Psychology:**
- "Try before you buy" reduces purchase anxiety
- 7-day reset creates urgency ("export before you lose it")
- Full features show value (not crippled trial)

#### Conversion Funnel

| Step | Action | Conversion |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Download demo | 100% |
| 2 | Open app within 24h | 60% |
| 3 | Use for 3+ days | 40% |
| 4 | Create 5+ notes | 25% |
| 5 | Return after reset | 15% |
| 6 | Purchase | **10%** |

**Demo-to-Paid Email Sequence:**

- **Day 2:** "How's your first impression?" + tips
- **Day 5:** "Your demo resets in 2 days" + export guide
- **Day 6:** "Don't lose your work" + 15% off offer
- **Day 7 (reset):** "Welcome back — want to pick up where you left off?" + purchase CTA
- **Day 10:** "Still thinking it over?" + FAQ + testimonials
- **Day 14:** "Final reminder: your 15% discount expires" + urgency

**Target:** 10% demo-to-paid conversion (industry average: 3-5%)

---

### 2. Demo Reset Creates Urgency

#### The Mechanism

Every 7 days, the demo:
- Clears all data
- Requires fresh download
- Preserves nothing

**The Message:**
> "Your demo resets in 2 days. Export your notes or upgrade to keep them forever."

#### Conversion Tactics

1. **Export Anxiety:**
   - Show users how many notes they'll lose
   - Make export slightly tedious (not impossible, but friction)
   - "Or... just upgrade and keep everything"

2. **Progress Loss Aversion:**
   - "You've created 23 notes this week"
   - "Your knowledge graph has 47 connections"
   - Visual representation of what resets

3. **The Easy Out:**
   - One-click upgrade from demo
   - Auto-imports demo data
   - "Continue where you left off"

---

### 3. Limited-Time Offers

#### Flash Sale Calendar

| Month | Offer | Duration | Expected Lift |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Feb** | Launch sale | 7 days | Baseline |
| **Mar** | "Spring cleaning" | 3 days | +25% |
| **May** | Mother's Day | 48 hours | +15% |
| **Jul** | Mid-year sale | 5 days | +30% |
| **Sep** | Back to work | 7 days | +20% |
| **Nov** | Black Friday | 7 days | +100% |
| **Dec** | Holiday bundle | 10 days | +40% |

#### Scarcity Tactics

- **Time-based:** "Ends in 23:59:59" countdown timer
- **Quantity-based:** "Only 50 at this price"
- **Persona-based:** "For students only" (verify with .edu)
- **Behavior-based:** "You left this in your cart — here's 10% off"

---

### 4. Social Proof Collection Plan

#### Review Generation System

**Automated Email Flow:**

- **Day 3 (post-purchase):** "How's it going?" + support offer
- **Day 7:** "Quick favor — how are you using MIND?"
- **Day 14:** "Love it? Leave a review" + link to Trustpilot/Gumroad
- **Day 30:** "Share your story" + testimonial request
- **Day 90:** "Still using it? Tell us why" + case study request

**Incentives:**
- Review → Entry in monthly giveaway
- Video testimonial → Free app of choice
- Case study → Lifetime suite + feature spotlight

#### Social Proof Displays

**On Website:**
- Rotating testimonial carousel
- "Trusted by X knowledge workers"
- Star rating aggregate
- Logo wall (if any notable users)

**In Product:**

3. **Product Hunt** (launch page)
4. **Reddit** (r/productivity, r/Notion, r/ObsidianMD)
5. **Twitter** (screenshots, threads)
