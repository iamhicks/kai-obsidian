## Questions? Answered.
#### How do I install these apps?

Simple. Download the HTML file, save it anywhere on your computer, and double-click to open in your browser. That's it. No installers, no admin rights, no fuss.

Right on your computer, in your browser's local storage. It never touches our servers — because we don't have any. Export anytime as JSON for backup or moving to another device.

#### Can I use these on multiple devices?

Absolutely. Copy the HTML file to any device. Use the export/import feature to move your data. Your license covers all your personal devices.

#### Do you offer refunds?

Yes. 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If these tools don't improve your workflow, you shouldn't pay for them.

#### Will there be updates?

Yes. All updates are free for life. When you buy, you're added to our update list. Just re-download the file when we announce new versions.
