## Features

### What is psychology tracking?

Before each trade, you log:
- Mood (1-10)
- Confidence level (1-10)
- Sleep quality (hours)
- Stress level (1-10)

After each trade:
- Discipline followed (Yes/Partially/No)
- Emotions felt (FOMO, fear, greed, etc.)
- Lessons learned

The app then shows you correlations like "I win 40% more when well-rested."

### Can I track multiple accounts?

Yes. The Pro version supports multiple accounts/portfolios with separate statistics.

### Does it connect to my broker?

No. This is intentional — it's a privacy-first manual journal. No API connections, no data sharing.

### Can I attach screenshots?

Yes. Each trade can include chart screenshots and notes.

### Is there a mobile app?

Not yet. The web app works on mobile browsers, but it's optimized for desktop. Mobile app is on the roadmap.

## Technical

### What are the system requirements?

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- 50MB disk space
- No internet required after download

### Is my data secure?

Yes. Your data is stored locally on your machine using browser local storage. It never touches our servers because we don't have any. You have complete control.

### What if I clear my browser cache?

Your data will be lost unless you've exported it. We recommend regular exports for backup.

### Can I use it on multiple devices?

Yes, but data doesn't sync automatically between devices. You'll need to manually transfer your data file.

### Is the code open source?

Not currently. It's a proprietary product.

---

## Pricing & Licensing

### Why is it so cheap compared to competitors?

Most competitors charge $25-50/month because they have ongoing server costs (cloud storage, syncing, etc.).

We built a local-first app with no server costs, so we can charge once and you're done.

### Can I get a refund?

Yes. 30-day money-back guarantee. Email support@tradingjournalpro.com for a full refund.

### Can I share my license?

Your license is for personal use. Please don't share it — support independent developers.

### Do you offer discounts?

Not currently. $24 is already priced fairly for a lifetime license.

## Trading Questions

### Does this give trade signals?

No. This is a journal for tracking and analyzing YOUR trades. It does not provide entry/exit signals or financial advice.

### Is this affiliated with TTrades or GxT?

No. We're independent traders who built a tool for the community. Not officially affiliated.
