# Session: 12-02-2026 (into 13-02)

## Accomplishments
- ✅ **FLOW Dashboard v2.0 — Mission Control COMPLETE**
  - Built 4 core modules in ~4 hours:
    1. **Kanban** — Drag-drop tasks, auto-backup, 3 default boards
    2. **Activity Stream** — Real-time log of AI actions, filters by type
    3. **Shared Memory** — Digital scratchpad between human & AI
    4. **Deliverables** — File manager for AI-created assets
  - Real-time sync system working (human ↔ AI via JSON files)
  - Product landing page created ($29 pricing)
  - Dark theme UI matching i_am_Hicks brand
  - Server API endpoints for all modules
  - Git commits and pushes throughout

## Blockers
- None — everything working!

## Next Step
- Pete wants to launch to OpenClaw community
- Next modules: Chat, Metrics (revenue tracking)
- Need to package for release (Gumroad)

## Reflection
- **Worked well:** File-based architecture — simple, transparent, no complex APIs
- **Lesson:** Iframe approach for kanban integration was quick but styling issues — full integration would be cleaner long-term
- **Win:** 4 modules in one session — this is a real product now!
