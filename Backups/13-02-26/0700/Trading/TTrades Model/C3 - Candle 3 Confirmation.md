## 🎯 What is C3?

**C3 = The third candle after a structure break**

C3 is the **confirmation candle** that validates or invalidates the setup. It's the preferred entry point in the TTrades Fractal Model and the foundation of Pete's trading approach.

## ✅ Why C3 is Preferred Over C2

| Factor | C2 (Candle 2) | C3 (Candle 3) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Timing** | Early signal | Confirmation |
| **Probability** | Lower (~50%) | Higher (~65-70%) |
| **Risk** | Higher | Lower |
| **Wick Size** | Often large | Small wicks preferred |
| **Setup Quality** | Can be false | Validates true intent |

### **The Problem with C2:**
> *"Don't try to trade candle twos that expand a ton because that is when you can get caught in a retracement, consolidation, or reversal."* - TTrades

**C2 Risks:**
- Price may still be finding direction
- Large wicks indicate indecision
- Can reverse into consolidation
- Higher chance of stop-out

### **The Power of C3:**
> *"C3 validates or invalidates the setup."* - TTrades

**C3 Benefits:**
- Shows true market intent
- Smaller wicks (committed move)
- Clearer structure
- Higher win rate

## 🔍 How to Identify C3

### **Step 1: Find the Structure Break**
- Previous high/low broken
- New swing forming
- Count from break candle = C1

### **Step 2: Analyze C2 (Second Candle)**
**Ideal C2 for C3 Setup:**
- Reversal candle formation
- Price opens, trades aggressively one way
- Then reverses strongly
- Closes near where it opened (indecision)
- **Large wick showing rejection**

> *"We have a nice reversal candle. Price opens, trades lower pretty aggressively, and that is met with an aggressive move higher closing relatively around the same point."*

### **Step 3: Trade C3 (Third Candle)**
- C3 continues the direction established by C2 reversal
- Look for small wick (expansion candle)
- Entry on C3 open or after CISD confirmation
- Target liquidity in that direction

## 📊 C3 Trade Setup Example

### **Bullish C3 Setup:**

**Daily Context:**
- Daily candle 1: Bearish (down move)
- Daily candle 2: **Reversal candle** (long lower wick, closes bullish)
- Daily candle 3: **C3 - Trade this bullish continuation**

**4H Alignment:**
- 4H shows C2 reversal at key level (OB/FVG)
- 4H C3 forming bullish

**1H Confirmation:**
- CISD confirmed (structure broke bullish)
- Protected swing established

**5M Entry:**
- Entry on C3 open OR
- Wait for CISD on 5M
- Stop below protected swing
- Target 1:2 R:R minimum

### **Bearish C3 Setup:**
Same structure, reversed:
- C2 reversal bearish
- C3 continues bearish
- Entry on breakdown

## ⚠️ C3 Red Flags (Avoid)

**Don't Trade C3 When:**

1. **C2 had massive expansion**
   - Price already moved too far
   - C3 may retrace/consolidate
   - Look for "less than ideal" label

2. **C2 took out all liquidity**
   - If C2 already hit target, no room for C3
   - "If candle 2 would have expanded all the way to this low, that's something I'm not ever really going to trade."

3. **No clear reversal on C2**
   - C2 must show reversal structure
   - Large wick rejecting direction
   - Without this, C3 has no setup

4. **Large wick on C3 forming**
   - Indicates indecision
   - May become C2 of next sequence
   - Wait for next C3

## 🎯 C3 Entry Checklist

**Before Entering C3 Trade:**

- [ ] **Daily bias clear** - Not fighting HTF
- [ ] **C2 reversal candle** - Nice wick, strong close
- [ ] **C2 didn't expand too much** - Room for C3 move
- [ ] **Key level present** - OB, FVG, or previous high/low
- [ ] **1H/30M CISD confirmed** - Structure broken
- [ ] **Protected swing established** - Stop placement logical
- [ ] **5M entry trigger** - Precise timing
- [ ] **1:2 R:R minimum** - Worth the risk

## ⏰ C3 Timing with 4H Profiling

**Your C3 setups are more likely to succeed when aligned with session expansion phases.**

### **Best Times for C3 Trades (Your Model):**

**London Reversal Profile:**
- **Trade C3 at:** 6am EST (NY open continuation)
- **Avoid C3 at:** 2am EST (London manipulation phase)

**NY Continuation Profile:**
- **Trade C3 at:** 6am-10am EST (continuation window)
- **When London sets HOD/LOD** → NY expands in same direction

**NY Reversal Profile:**
- **Trade C3 at:** 10am-2pm EST (NY sets new HOD/LOD)
- Wait for reversal pattern on C2, then C3 continuation

### **Application to Your Schedule:**

**You trade 13:30 GMT (1:30 PM your time)** = 8:30 AM EST (before NY fully expands)

**This means:**
- Look for C3 setups forming **before** you start trading
- By 13:30 GMT, C3 should be confirmed (or close to it)
- Enter on 1H CISD during NY expansion phase
- Target: NY continuation to 10am-2pm EST

> *"Don't try to trade candle twos that expand a ton because that is when you can get caught in a retracement, consolidation, or reversal."*

## 🚀 Practice Exercise

**On Your Charts:**
1. Mark recent 4H structure breaks
2. Count C1, C2, C3 from break
3. Identify C2 reversal candles
4. See how C3 performed
5. Track win rate: C2 entries vs C3 entries

**Expected Result:** C3 entries should show higher win rate and better R:R.
