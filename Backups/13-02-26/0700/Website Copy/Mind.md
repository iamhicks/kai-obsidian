## Frequently Asked Questions

$29 seems expensive for a notes app. Why not just use free alternatives?

It's $29 once, not $10/month forever. Break-even vs Notion is 3 months. After that, you're saving money every month. Plus, free alternatives either harvest your data, show ads, or limit features. MIND respects your privacy and gives you everything upfront.

Does it sync between devices?

Not built-in (privacy first!). But you can use any sync you trust: Dropbox, iCloud, Syncthing, or just export/import. Your notes are standard Markdown files, so they work with any sync solution.

What if you stop updating it?

You own it forever. No subscription means no risk of losing access. It works today, it'll work in 10 years. The code doesn't expire. If we disappeared tomorrow, you'd still have a fully functional notes app.

Is it as powerful as Notion?

For personal knowledge management? Yes. For databases and team collaboration? No — and that's intentional. We focused on what 90% of people actually need: fast, private, beautiful note-taking without the bloat.

Can I import from other apps?

Yes! MIND supports Markdown import, which most apps can export to. Bring your notes from Notion, Obsidian, Bear, or anywhere else.

Is there a refund policy?

Yes. 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If MIND doesn't work for you, we'll refund every penny.
