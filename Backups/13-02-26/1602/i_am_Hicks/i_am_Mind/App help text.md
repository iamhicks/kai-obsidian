## Organization Tips

### PARA Method

Popular organization system:
- **Projects:** Active work with deadlines
- **Areas:** Ongoing responsibilities
- **Resources:** Reference material
- **Archive:** Completed or inactive

Create folders for each and drag notes accordingly.

### Daily Notes

Create a new note each day:
- Name it with the date: `2026-02-12`
- Quick capture throughout the day
- Review and move items to permanent notes

### Idea Capture

Don't organize immediately:
1. Dump ideas into a **Inbox** folder
2. Review weekly
3. Move to appropriate folders
4. Archive when processed

It's moved to the **Archive** folder. You can restore it from there or permanently delete it.

Yes. All AI processing happens on your computer. No internet needed after initial setup.

Absolutely. Nothing leaves your machine. Your data is yours alone.
