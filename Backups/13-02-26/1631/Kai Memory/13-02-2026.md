# Session Summary - 13-02-2026

**Date:** 13-02-2026  
**Duration:** ~5 hours  
**Focus:** FLOW Dashboard v2 — Chat Module & UI Polish  
**Outcome:** Major progress on Unified Chat, cross-module integration complete

---

## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ FLOW Dashboard v2 — Major Features
- **Unified Chat Module** — Fully implemented with real-time search
  - Cross-channel message aggregation (Telegram + FlowChat)
  - Instant search with text highlighting
  - Smart auto-scroll (preserves position when searching/scrolled up)
  - MIND-style UI: user bubble, AI no bubble, no avatars
  - Send button positioned inside message field
  - Clean layout: search → channels → messages → input
  
- **Cross-Module Event Bus** — All modules now communicate
  - Chat messages → Activity Stream
  - Kanban card moves → Activity Stream  
  - Kai file edits → Activity + Memory
  - Real-time polling (3s Activity, 5s Memory)

- **Auto-Memory Extraction** — Self-documenting system
  - Parses daily logs hourly for accomplishments/decisions
  - Extracts from Kai Profile file edits (SOUL, IDENTITY, USER, etc.)
  - Auto-categorizes (identity, preference, trading, business, milestone)

### ✅ UI/UX Refinements
- MIND color palette integration (light: #ffffff/#f7f6f3, dark: #191919/#202020)
- Theme toggle button (moon/sun icon in header)
- Collapsible left sidebar with real data widgets
- Gateway Status card with restart button
- Token Usage widget showing session stats
- Removed demo data from System Dashboard — now shows real OpenClaw data

### ✅ Bug Fixes
- Kanban auto-refresh every 5 seconds (no manual sync needed)
- Persistent backup folder (IndexedDB, no re-prompting)
- Search filter preserved during message polling
- Fixed broken HTML structure in chat module
- Channel filtering removed (now static display only)

### ✅ Documentation
- Created comprehensive FLOW Module Documentation (9 modules documented)
- Created Unified Chat Feature documentation
- Updated STANDING_ORDERS.md with ORDER 17 (auto-start To Do tasks)
- All docs synced to Obsidian

## Technical Decisions

### Chat Architecture
- **Read-only aggregation** — FLOW shows messages from all channels but doesn't send
- **No conversation threading** — Simple chronological timeline (all messages are Pete↔Kai)
- **Search-first design** — Finding old messages more important than filtering
- **WebChat renamed to FlowChat** — Clearer branding

### Cross-Module Strategy
- EventBus pattern for loose coupling
- File-based storage (JSON) with in-memory caching
- Background polling keeps UI responsive

## Current State

### Working Features
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Kanban | ✅ Auto-save, auto-refresh, templates |
| Activity Stream | ✅ Real-time, all events logged |
| Memory | ✅ Auto-extraction, 5s refresh |
| Unified Chat | ✅ Search, aggregation, clean UI |
| Kai Profile | ✅ File editing, auto-memory |
| Skills Browser | ✅ Static catalog |
| System Dashboard | ✅ Real data (crons, channels, tokens) |
| Schedule/Heartbeat | ✅ Daily rhythm tracking |

### Still Pending
- **Overdue Status** task in kanban (needs clarification)
- Screenshot paste in chat (complex, deferred)
- Final UI polish pass

---

## Next Steps
1. Clarify "Overdue Status" requirement
2. Test all modules with OpenClaw community
3. Prepare for launch ($29 pricing)

---

## Reflection

**What worked:** Iterative UI refinement with Pete — rapid feedback loops produced clean, minimal design. The "Unified Chat" feature evolved from simple aggregation to powerful search tool.

**What didn't:** Over-engineered channel filtering initially. Simpler is better — static channel display + universal search beats complex filtering.
