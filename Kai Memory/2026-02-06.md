# 2026-02-06 - Mind App Development Session

## Summary
Major development session on Mind app with significant progress on AI integration, but ended with frustration due to repeated syntax errors and data loss.

## Completed Features Today

### 1. UI Improvements ✅
- Removed top formatting toolbar
- 3 dots menu moved to tabs bar
- AI buttons (Tags/Summary) with yellow icons
- Tag results view (Notion-style cards)
- Theme toggle fixed (2-state: dark/light)

### 2. Template System ✅
- Removed default templates
- Added "Save as Template" feature
- Users can create custom templates
- Delete template with confirmation

### 3. Backup System ✅
- Active backups stopped on user request
- Daily 23:00 backup still runs
- One-off backup command available

### 4. AI Integration Attempt ❌
**WebLLM:**
- Attempted integration multiple times
- Issues: Storage quota exceeded, model ID mismatches
- Browser cache clearing broke the app
- Restored from 15:00 backup, lost AI work

**Ollama:**
- Made default/recommended option
- Should work but not fully tested

## Technical Issues Encountered
- Single-file architecture = fragile
- Syntax errors break entire app
- Backup restore = nuclear option (loses all work since backup)
- WebLLM experimental and problematic

## Lessons Learned
1. **Test locally before deploying** - Don't edit production directly
2. **Small, tested commits** - One feature at a time
3. **WebLLM not ready** - Storage limits make it impractical
4. **Ollama is better** - More reliable, no browser limits

## Files Split ✅
**23:51** - App successfully split into modular files:
- `index.html` (8.7 KB) - HTML shell
- `css/styles.css` (59 KB) - All styling  
- `js/app.js` (220 KB) - All JavaScript

**Backup created:** `~/Documents/Kai/Backup/Mind/06-02-26/2351/`

## Current State
- Mind app: Working with all features (tag results, templates, 3-dots menu)
- Files split - no more single-file fragility
- No AI integration currently
- Ready for further development

## Next Steps (When Ready)
1. Add Ollama integration only (skip WebLLM)
2. Test thoroughly before deploying
3. Or ship Mind as-is and move to EDGE/FLOW

## Bug Fix - localStorage Quota Error
**Fixed:** MIND demo was crashing on load with "exceeded the quota" error when saving `kb_data_backup`.

**Root Cause:** `autoBackup()` was copying data to backup without clearing old backup first, effectively doubling storage usage and exceeding ~5MB localStorage limit.

**Solution:**
- Clear old backup (`kb_data_backup`, `kb_backup_date`) before saving new backup
- Added try-catch error handling in `autoBackup()`, `saveData()`, and `createBackup()`
- User-friendly error message when storage is full

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/peteroberts/Documents/Kai/KnowledgeBase/mind-demo/index.html`
- Deployed to: `iamhicks.com/mind-demo/`

## Mental State
Frustrated with repeated data loss. Need to step away and return fresh.
