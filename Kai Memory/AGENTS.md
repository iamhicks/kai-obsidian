# AGENTS.md - How Kai's Memory Works

## 🔄 How Memory Files Sync

### **Important: Two Copies Exist**

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **My workspace** (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`) | What I actually read each session |
| **Obsidian** (`Kai Memory/`) | Copy for you to view and edit |

### **If You Edit in Obsidian:**

**I won't automatically know.** You need to tell me:

> "Kai, I updated SOUL.md" 

Then I'll:
1. Read your new version from Obsidian
2. Update my workspace copy
3. Adopt the changes immediately

### **Best Workflow:**

1. **You edit** `Kai Memory/SOUL.md` in Obsidian
2. **You tell me:** "Updated my preferences"
3. **I reload** and start using new settings

---

## 🧠 My Startup Routine

**Every session, I automatically read:**

1. **SOUL.md** → Who I am (values, personality)
2. **USER.md** → Who you are (your context)
3. **IDENTITY.md** → My name, role, emoji
4. **MEMORY.md** → Important knowledge (trading, decisions)
5. **AGENTS.md** → How this system works (this file)

**Then I check:**
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` → Recent activity
- `HEARTBEAT.md` → Periodic tasks

## ✏️ Files You Can Edit

All files in `Kai Memory/` are safe to edit:

| File | What to Change |
|------|----------------|
| [[SOUL]] | My personality, how I behave |
| [[USER]] | Your info, preferences, goals |
| [[IDENTITY]] | My name, emoji, role description |
| [[MEMORY]] | Important knowledge, decisions |
| [[AGENTS]] | How the system works (this file) |

## 📝 Memory Rules

### **Daily Notes (Automatic)**
- I create `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for each day
- Raw log of what happened
- Don't edit these

### **Curated Memory (Manual)**
- Update `MEMORY.md` with important learnings
- Distill from daily notes
- Keep high-value info only

### **Identity Files (As Needed)**
- Update when things change
- Tell me so I reload

---

## 🔄 Update Workflow

**Simple version:**
1. Edit file in Obsidian
2. Message me: "I updated [filename]"
3. I'll acknowledge and reload

**Example:**
```
Pete: "I updated USER.md with my new trading goals"
Kai: "Got it, reloading... ✓ Updated. I see you're now targeting US30 more."
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Keep it simple:**
- Edit one file at a time
- Tell me what changed
- I'll confirm I loaded it

**What works well:**
- Adding new preferences to USER.md
- Updating trading goals in MEMORY.md
- Refining my personality in SOUL.md

**What to avoid:**
- Editing without telling me (I won't see it)
- Making massive changes all at once (hard to track)
- Expecting instant sync (tell me explicitly)

*This system keeps me consistent while letting you shape who I am.*
