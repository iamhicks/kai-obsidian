## Technical Decisions

1. **Memory date format:** DD-MM-YYYY to match Pete's preference
2. **Folder structure:** Daily Sessions / Reference / Archive
3. **Defer Mission Control:** Build after i_am_Hicks products launched

## Future Projects (Deferred)

### Mission Control Dashboard
**Source:** Alex Finn's recommendation via X/Twitter  
**Status:** Deferred — revisit after MIND/EDGE/FLOW/VAULT complete  

**Components:**
1. **Activity feed** — tracks everything OpenClaw does
2. **Calendar view** — visual weekly view of scheduled tasks
3. **Global search** — unified search across all memories, tasks, documents

**Tech stack suggested:** NextJS + Convex + Codex  
**Effort estimate:** 22-32 hours (3-4 days)  
**Alternative:** Quick file-based versions (1-2 hours) as interim solution

**Decision:** Hold for now, revisit after product suite complete

---

## Current State
- Memory system: Fully organized and operational
- MIND demo: Ready for testing (from previous session)
- Next priority: Test MIND tag results, then continue with EDGE/FLOW/VAULT

---

## Next Steps
1. Test MIND demo tag results (clear cache first)
2. Fix any remaining issues with tag results
3. Continue with EDGE, FLOW, VAULT demos
4. **Revisit Mission Control** after product suite launched

---

## Notes
- Pete wants to come back to Mission Control later — logged in MEMORY.md
- Memory system now self-documenting via README.md
- All synced to Obsidian with proper structure
