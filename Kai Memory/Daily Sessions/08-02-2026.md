# Session Summary - 08-02-2026

## Accomplishments

### Mission Control Dashboard
- ✅ Created secure Mission Control dashboard at https://iamhicks.com/mission-control/
- ✅ Added password protection (default: kai2024) to prevent public access
- ✅ Removed sensitive data from display (gateway port, file paths, connection IDs)
- ✅ Sanitized export-data.sh to mask connection IDs and internal paths
- ✅ Dashboard shows real OpenClaw data (cron jobs, system status, recent logs)
- ✅ GMT timestamps for all log entries

### Cron Jobs
- ✅ Disabled trading crons (Bias Check, NY Open) per user request
- ✅ Verified Daily Backup cron is working (fired at 23:00 GMT as scheduled)
- ✅ Confirmed cron jobs are healthy and scheduling correctly

### Ollama Setup
- ✅ Downloaded Gemma 3 4B model for local AI tasks
- ✅ Discussed hybrid model strategy (local for simple tasks, cloud for complex)
- ⏸️ Task router implementation paused until user gives go-ahead

### Security Improvements
- ✅ Password protection on Mission Control dashboard
- ✅ Removed gateway port from public view
- ✅ Masked connection IDs in logs
- ✅ Removed non-functional "Backup Now" button

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Password protect dashboard | Public website hosting sensitive system info |
| Use Gemma 3 4B for local | Good balance of quality/speed for simple tasks |
| Disable trading crons | User confirmed they weren't working as expected |
| Keep GMT timestamps | User requested GMT timezone for all times |

## Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Mission Control | ✅ Live, secured with password |
| Trading crons | ❌ Disabled |
| Backup cron | ✅ Active (23:00 GMT daily) |
| Ollama | ✅ Installed, Gemma 3 ready |
| Task router | ⏸️ Pending user go-ahead |

## Next Steps

1. **Implement task router** — Auto-switch between Ollama (simple tasks) and Kimi K2.5 (complex tasks)
2. **Test hybrid workflow** — Verify Gemma 3 handles documentation/file tasks acceptably
3. **Monitor costs** — Measure token savings from task-based routing
4. **Change Mission Control password** — Default is insecure (kai2024)

## Lessons

- **Security first** — Dashboard was publicly accessible with gateway port exposed. Fixed before any harm.
- **Timezone clarity** — GMT = UTC, user is PST (8 hours behind). Cron jobs run at correct GMT time.
- **Hybrid models save tokens** — Estimated 30-40% savings by routing simple tasks to local models.
