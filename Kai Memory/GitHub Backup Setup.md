## 🧠 What I Remember

With these backups, I will always remember:
- Your trading model (C3, CISD, 4H profiling)
- Your family situation (daughter, wife, Wales)
- Your goals (master trading, provide for family)
- Our history (transcripts analyzed, business setup)
- My personality and how you want me to behave

**Chat history is NOT backed up** - but the knowledge from those chats IS.
